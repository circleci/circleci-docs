We use GitHub's labels to organize work on docs. Each issue has 3 labels: Status, Type & Priority.

## Status

Status labels tell us how work on an issue is progressing:

- Available: open for development
- Blocked: dependency preventing progress
- Completed: closed & resolved
- In Progress: in development
- Review Needed: reviewer assigned, giving feedback
- Revision Needed: review complete, addressing comments
- Wontfix: closed & unresolved

## Type

Type labels tell us about the kind of issue:

- Bug: technical problem
- Design: visual changes
- Draft: new documentation
- Edit: changes to existing docs
- Feature: new functionality
- Maintenance: refactor & reorganize

## Priority

Priority labels tell us how important an issue is:

- High: today
- Medium: this week
- Low: this month

To create our label system, we borrowed liberally from this article about [sane GitHub labels](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63#.c2sqrwkkg).
