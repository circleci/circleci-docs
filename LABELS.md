We use GitHub's labels to organize work on docs. Each issue has 3 labels: Status, Type & Priority.

## Status

Status labels tell us how work on an issue is progressing:

- Completed: closed & resolved
- Confirmed: ready for development
- In Progress: in development
- Unconfirmed: needs confirmation
- Wontfix: closed & unresolved

## Type

Type labels tell us about the kind of issue:

- Bug: technical problem
- Draft: new doc
- Edit: improve copy
- Feature: new functionality
- Maintenance: refactor or reorganize

## Priority

Priority labels tell us how important an issue is:

- High: this week
- Medium: this month
- Low: this year

To create our labels, we borrowed liberally from this article about [sane GitHub labels](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63#.c2sqrwkkg).
