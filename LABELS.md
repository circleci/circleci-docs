We use GitHub's labels to organize work on docs. Each issue has 3 labels: Status, Type & Priority.

## Status
Status labels give information about how work is progressing on an issue:

- Status: Abandoned
- Status: Available
- Status: Blocked
- Status: Completed
- Status: In Progress
- Status: On Hold
- Status: Review Needed
- Status: Revision Needed

## Type
Type labels give information about the kind of issue:

- Type: Enhancement
- Type: Inaccuracy
- Type: Question
- Type: Structure
- Type: Typo

## Priority
Priority labels tell us how important an issue is:

- Priority: High
- Priority: Medium
- Priority: Low

To create our label system, we borrowed liberally from this article about [sane GitHub labels](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63#.c2sqrwkkg).
