= Build Artifacts

Build artifacts persist data after a job is completed. They can be used for longer-term storage of your build process outputs. For example, when a Java build/test process finishes, the output of the process is saved as a `.jar` file. CircleCI can store this file as an artifact, keeping it available long after the process has finished.

== Safe and Unsafe Content Types
By default, only pre-defined artifact types are allowed. This protects users from uploading, and potentially executing malicious content. The 'allowed-list' is as follows:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]

== Allow Unsafe Content types
If you would like to allow content types that are not included in the list above, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the CircleCI Management Console (for example, `<your-circleci-hostname>:8800/settings`) and select Settings from the menu bar.
2. Scroll down to find the Artifacts section.
3. Select Serve Artifacts with Unsafe Content-Types.

4. Click Save at the bottom of the page and Restart Now in the pop-up to save your changes and restart the console.

WARNING: Any change to the settings within the Management Console will incur downtime as the console will need to be restarted.
