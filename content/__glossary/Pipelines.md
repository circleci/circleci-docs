term: Pipeline
--- 

A pipeline is an object that you may configure and run on the CircleCI platform. A pipeline can be triggered through webhooks when code is pushed to your git repository, or when you use the CircleCI API. The pipeline's configuration includes workflows and jobs that may be run with other elements like parameters and orbs. 

Note that each pipeline is run against a particular project by a specific actor.
