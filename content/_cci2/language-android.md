This document describes how to set up an Android project on CircleCI in the
following sections.

* TOC
{:toc}


## Prerequisites
{: #prerequisites }
{:.no_toc}

This guide assumes the following:

- You are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build your Android project. Gradle is the default build tool
for projects created with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Your project is located in the root of your VCS repository.
- The project's application is located in a subfolder named `app`.

**Note:** CircleCI offers an Android machine image available on CircleCI
Cloud that supports x86 Android emulators and nested virtualization.
Documentation on how to access it is available
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/android-machine-image). Another way to run emulator
tests from a job is to consider using an external service like [Firebase Test
Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab). For more details, see the
[Testing With Firebase Test Lab](#testing-with-firebase-test-lab) section below.


## Sample configuration for UI tests
{: #sample-configuration-for-ui-tests }

Let's walk through a sample configuration using the Android machine image. It is
possible to use both orbs and to manually configure the use of the Android
machine image to best suit your project.

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yaml
version: 2.1 # to enable orb usage, you must be using circleci 2.1
# Declare the orbs you wish to use.
# Android orb docs are available here:  https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/android
orbs:
  android: circleci/android@1.0
workflows:
  test:
    jobs:
      # This job uses the Android machine image by default
      - android/run-ui-tests:
          # Use pre-steps and post-steps if necessary
          # to execute custom steps before and afer any of the built-in steps
          system-image: system-images;android-29;default;x86
```

As per above, using the Android orb will simplify your
configuration; you can compare and contrast examples of different sizes
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/android-machine-image#examples).


## Sample configuration for unit tests
{: #sample-configuration-for-unit-tests }

For convenience, CircleCI provides a set of Docker images for building Android apps. These pre-built images are available in the [CircleCI org on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/android/). The source code and Dockerfiles for these images are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-images/tree/master/android).

The CircleCI Android image is based on the [`openjdk:11-jdk`](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/) official Docker image, which is based on [buildpack-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). The base OS is Debian Jessie, and builds run as the `circleci` user, which has full access to passwordless `sudo`.

The following example demonstrates using an Android docker image rather than the Android machine image.

{% raw %}

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/code
    docker:
      - image: circleci/android:api-30-alpha
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    environment:
      JVM_OPTS: -Xmx3200m
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          key: jars-{{ checksum "build.gradle" }}-{{ checksum  "app/build.gradle" }}
#      - run:
#         name: Chmod permissions #if permission for Gradlew Dependencies fail, use this.
#         command: sudo chmod +x ./gradlew
      - run:
          name: Download Dependencies
          command: ./gradlew androidDependencies
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ~/.gradle
          key: jars-{{ checksum "build.gradle" }}-{{ checksum  "app/build.gradle" }}
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: ./gradlew lint test
      - store_artifacts: # for display in Artifacts: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/
          path: app/build/reports
          destination: reports
      - store_test_results: # for display in Test Summary: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/
          path: app/build/test-results
      # See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/ for deploy examples
```
{% endraw %}

### React Native projects
{: #react-native-projects }
{:.no_toc}

React Native projects can be built on CircleCI 2.0 using Linux, Android
and macOS capabilities. Please check out [this example React Native
application](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-react-native)
on GitHub for a full example of a React Native project.

## Testing with Firebase Test Lab
{: #testing-with-firebase-test-lab }

**Note:**: While this portion of the document walks through using a third party
tool for testing, CircleCI recommends using the [Android machine
image]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/android-machine-image) for running emulator tests.

To use Firebase Test Lab with CircleCI, first complete the following steps.

1. **Create a Firebase project.**
Follow the instructions in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/command-line#create_a_firebase_project).

2. **Install and authorize the Google Cloud SDK.**
Follow the instructions in the [Authorizing the Google Cloud SDK]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/google-auth/) document.

    **Note:**
    Instead of `google/cloud-sdk`,
    consider using an [Android convenience image]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/circleci-images/#android),
    which includes `gcloud` and Android-specific tools.

3. **Enable required APIs.**
Using the service account you created,
log into Google
and go to the [Google Developers Console API Library page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
Enable the **Google Cloud Testing API** and the **Cloud Tool Results API**
by typing their names into the search box at the top of the console
and clicking **Enable API**.

In your `.circleci/config.yml` file,
add the following `run` steps.

1. **Build the debug APK and test APK.**
Use Gradle to build two APKs.
To improve build performance,
consider [disabling pre-dexing](#disabling-pre-dexing-to-improve-build-performance).

2. **Store the service account.**
Store the service account you created in a local JSON file.

3. **Authorize `gcloud`**.
Authorize the `gcloud` tool
and set the default project.

4. **Use `gcloud` to test with Firebase Test Lab.**
Adjust the paths to the APK files
to correspond to your project.

5. **Install `crcmod` and use `gsutil` to copy test results data.**
`crcmod` is required
to use `gsutil`.
Use `gsutil`
to download the newest files in the bucket to the CircleCI artifacts folder.
Be sure to replace `BUCKET_NAME` and `OBJECT_NAME` with project-specific names.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/android:api-28-alpha  # gcloud is baked into this image
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Build debug APK and release APK
          command: |
            ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
            ./gradlew :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
      - run:
          name: Store Google Service Account
          command: echo $GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY > ${HOME}/gcloud-service-key.json
      - run:
          name: Authorize gcloud and set config defaults
          command: |
            sudo gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=${HOME}/gcloud-service-key.json
            sudo gcloud --quiet config set project ${GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID}
      - run:
          name: Test with Firebase Test Lab
          command: >
            sudo gcloud firebase test android run \
              --app <local_server_path>/<app_apk>.apk \
              --test <local_server_path>/<app_test_apk>.apk \
              --results-bucket cloud-test-${GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID}
      - run:
          name: Install gsutil dependency and copy test results data
          command: |
            sudo pip install -U crcmod
            sudo gsutil -m cp -r -U `sudo gsutil ls gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[OBJECT_NAME] | tail -1` ${CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS}/ | true
```

For more details on using `gcloud` to run Firebase,
see the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/command-line).


## Deployment
{: #deployment }

See the [Deploy]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/deployment-integrations/) document for examples of deploy target configurations.

## Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting }

### Handling out of memory errors
{: #handling-out-of-memory-errors }

You might run into out of memory (oom) errors with your build. To get acquainted
with the basics of customizing the JVM's memory usage, consider reading the
[Debugging Java OOM errors]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/java-oom/) document.

If you are using [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) for testing you may need to make tweaks to gradle's
use of memory. When the gradle vm is forked for tests it does not receive
previously customized JVM memory parameters. You will need to supply Gradle with
additional JVM heap for tests in your `build.gradle` file by adding `android.testOptions.unitTests.all { maxHeapSize = "1024m" }`. You can also add `all { maxHeapSize = "1024m" }` to your existing Android config block, which could look like so after the addition:

```groovy
android {
    testOptions {
        unitTests {
            // Any other configurations

            all {
                maxHeapSize = "1024m"
            }
        }
    }
```

If you are still running into OOM issues you can also limit the max workers for
gradle: `./gradlew test --max-workers 4`

### Disabling pre-dexing to improve build performance
{: #disabling-pre-dexing-to-improve-build-performance }
{:.no_toc}

Pre-dexing dependencies has no benefit on CircleCI.
To disable pre-dexing,
refer to [this blog post](http://www.littlerobots.nl/blog/disable-android-pre-dexing-on-ci-builds/).

By default,
the Gradle Android plugin pre-dexes dependencies.
Pre-dexing speeds up development
by converting Java bytecode into Android bytecode,
allowing incremental dexing
as you change code.
CircleCI runs clean builds,
so pre-dexing actually increases compilation time
and may also increase memory usage.

### Deploying to Google Play Store
{: #deploying-to-google-play-store }

There are a few third-party solutions for deploying to the Play Store from your
CI build. [Gradle Play
Publisher](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher) enables you to
upload an App Bundle/APK as well as app metadata. It's also possible to use
[Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/) with Android.
