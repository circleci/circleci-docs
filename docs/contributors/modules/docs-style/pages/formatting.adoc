[#styling-text]
== Styling text

* Use **bold** for GUI menu options and button text. For example:
** Select **Organization Settings** from the sidebar
** Select **VCS** in the **Project Settings** window
** Select **Projects** from the sidebar and click **Set Up Project** for the project you want to follow

* Use italics for commonly understood technical concepts (not CircleCI features of concepts). For example:
** _Continuous Integration_
** _Concurrency_
** _Parallelism_

[#using-notes-tips-cautions-warnings]
== Using notes, tips, cautions, and warnings

The following _admonitions_ are available. Admonitions create a visual separation from the rest of the text:

* Note
* Tip
* Important
* Caution
* Warning

[#when-to-use-each-type]
=== When to use each type

* `note`: Use to add some supplementary information to a section or point that needs highlighting to draw the reader's attention.
* `tip`: Use to add some guidance on how to carry out a step or how to act on some advice contained within the section.
* `important`: This admonition type is not used often in CircleCI docs. Consider whether one of the other options is a better fit before using.
* `caution`: Use to make the reader aware they need to be careful when acting on some advice.
* `warning`: Use to indicate that there are dangers or consequences associated with some information or steps.
