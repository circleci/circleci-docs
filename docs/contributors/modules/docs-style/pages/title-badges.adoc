= Page title badges

Add visual badges next to page titles to indicate content status. Currently we are using a `Preview` badge to indicate when a page is for a feature in open or closed preview.

A page is closed preview will display the `Preview` badge and **will not be** listed in the navigation.
A page in open preview will display the `Preview` badge and **will be** listed in the navigation.

== Basic usage

```asciidoc
= Page Title
:page-badge: Preview
```

This displays a simple badge with default styling (black text, border, no background).

== Custom styling with Tailwind classes

```asciidoc
= Page Title
:page-badge: Preview
:page-badge-classes: text-white bg-orange-500 border border-orange-600
```

== Custom colors with hex values

```asciidoc
= Page Title
:page-badge: Preview
:page-badge-bg: #FF6B35
:page-badge-border: #C44D2C
:page-badge-classes: text-white
```

== Common badge styles

**Preview:**
```asciidoc
:page-badge: Preview
```

Currently we are not adding styling to these badges but this may change in future.
