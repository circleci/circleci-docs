# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Reset Process on CircleCI

## Overview

This document outlines CircleCI's Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements and reset processes, including setup, recovery, and support escalation for both email/password and VCS-based logins.

---

## MFA Requirement Timeline

- **Email/Password Logins:**
  - MFA is currently optional.
  - **Mandatory from December 1, 2025:** Users must enable MFA to access their accounts after this date. Users who do not enable MFA before this date will be unable to log in [Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/permissions-authentication/mfa/).

- **VCS Logins (GitHub/Bitbucket):**
  - MFA is managed by the VCS provider, not CircleCI.
  - Users must enable MFA on their GitHub or Bitbucket accounts directly.
  - CircleCI honors the authentication and MFA status from the VCS provider [Enable 2FA for VCS](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015982988-Does-CircleCI-Support-Two-Factor-Authentication).

## Enabling MFA for Email/Password Accounts

1. Log in to the [CircleCI web app](https://app.circleci.com/home/).
2. Go to your profile (top right) → **User Settings**.
3. Select **Password & authentication** from the sidebar.
4. In the **Multi-factor authentication** section, click **Add authenticator app**.
5. Enter your password when prompted.
6. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.).
7. Enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by your app.
8. **Copy and securely store the recovery code** – this is only displayed once.
9. MFA status will update to **Enabled**.

> **Critical note:** If both the authenticator app and recovery code are lost, account access cannot be restored. Users must store their recovery code in a secure location [Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/permissions-authentication/mfa/).

## MFA Reset Process

The MFA reset process depends on the user's situation and whether they retain access to their account.

### Scenario 1: User Still Has Account Access

If the user can log in and wants to reconfigure their authenticator app or regenerate their recovery code:

1. Go to **User Settings** in the CircleCI web app.
2. Select **Password & authentication**.
3. In the **Multi-factor authentication** section, select **Add/edit authenticator app**.
4. Enter your password and OTP when prompted.
5. Follow the setup steps to scan the new QR code with your authenticator app.
6. Click **Regenerate recovery code** to generate a new code.
7. **Store the new recovery code securely** – it will only be displayed once, and the previous code becomes invalid [MFA recovery codes](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/permissions-authentication/mfa/#mfa-recovery-codes).

### Scenario 2: User Is Locked Out (No Authenticator App or Recovery Code)

If the user has lost access to both their authenticator app and recovery code, they are locked out of their CircleCI account. CircleCI cannot bypass MFA for security reasons. The only way to regain access is through their recovery code. Support cannot reset MFA if the user has no recovery code and cannot verify their identity [Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/permissions-authentication/mfa/).

### Scenario 3: Support-Initiated MFA Reset

In some cases, if a locked-out user can verify their identity through account information, CircleCI support may reset MFA on a case-by-case basis. Identity verification may include login email address, account name, geographic location, IP address, or other account-specific information. This process is referenced in support interactions [Zendesk Ticket: Can't log in with MFA](https://circleci.zendesk.com/tickets/165213).

## Recovery Code Management

- The recovery code is a one-time use backup code provided during MFA setup.
- Users can regenerate it in **User Settings** → **Password & authentication** → **Regenerate recovery code**.
- Each regenerated code invalidates the previous one.
- Codes are only displayed once during generation.
- Users should update their stored copy when regenerating.
- The recovery code is the last resort for account recovery – if lost, account access cannot be restored without support intervention [MFA recovery codes](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/permissions-authentication/mfa/#mfa-recovery-codes).

---

## Enabling MFA for VCS Logins

- **GitHub:** Enable 2FA via GitHub's security settings.
- **Bitbucket:** Enable 2FA via Bitbucket's security settings.

CircleCI does not manage or enforce MFA for VCS logins – it relies entirely on the provider's authentication system [Enable 2FA for VCS](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015982988-Does-CircleCI-Support-Two-Factor-Authentication).

---

## Support Escalation Summary

- **User has recovery code:** Guide them through self-service reset via User Settings.
- **User locked out, no recovery code:** Escalate to support for identity verification and case-by-case assessment.
- **VCS login issues:** Direct to VCS provider support.
