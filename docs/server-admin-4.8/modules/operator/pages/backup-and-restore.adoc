[#overview-backup]
== Overview

When operating and administering CircleCI server, you will need to consider how to maintain backups and recover your installation, should there be a need to migrate it to another cluster or recover from a critical event.

CircleCI recommends link:https://velero.io/[Velero] for backup and restore. The benefit of this approach is that it not only restores your application's data,
but it also restores the state of the Kubernetes cluster and its resources at the time of the backup. CirleCI server supports backup and restore with Velero `1.12`. This document outlines recommendations for how to back up and restore your CircleCI server instance data and state using link:https://velero.io/[Velero].

NOTE: Backup and restore of the CircleCI services is dependent on Velero. If your cluster is lost, you will not be able to restore CircleCI until you have successfully started Velero in the cluster. From there you can recover the CircleCI services.

[#installing-velero]
== Velero installation

To use Velero, you must first install the link:https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/basic-install/[Velero CLI]. Then using Velero's CLI, you will need to install the Velero server components along with the appropriate plugin for your cloud storage solution. Follow the instructions linked below based on your chosen storage backend:

* link:https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws#overview[AWS S3]
* link:https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#overview[GCP GCS]
* link:https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/contributions/minio/[S3 Compatible (MinIO)]

NOTE: CircleCI server makes use of Persistent Volumes for data storage. To include these volumes in your backups you will need to add the node agent flag `--use-node-agent` to your Velero install command. link:https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/customize-installation/#enable-file-system-backup[Read here] for more information.

[#creating-backups]
== Creating backups

Now that Velero is installed on your cluster, you are ready to create your first backup.

NOTE: For best results, we recommend that the backup be taken during a time when your CircleCI server instance is not in use. This is to ensure the data is not being altered while the backup is being generated, which limits the possibility of lost or corrupted data. You may use the following command to scale down the application's services so that no jobs are running during the backup. No data is lost in this process, but the application will be unreachable. Alternatively you may choose to schedule your backups to be done during a time when your CircleCI server instance is not in use.

[source,bash]
----
namespace=<your-server-namespace>
kubectl -n "$namespace" scale deploy -l "layer=application" --replicas="0"
----

Once you are ready, you may use the following command to create a backup of your CircleCI server instance.

[source,bash]

----
K8S_NS=<your_server_namespace>
CHART=$(helm list -n "$K8S_NS" -o yaml  | yq '.[].chart' )
REV=$(helm list -n "$K8S_NS" -o yaml  | yq '.[].revision')
RANDOM_STR=$(cat /dev/urandom | env LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-z0-9' | head -c 8)

velero backup create "${K8S_NS}-${RANDOM_STR}" --include-namespaces "${K8S_NS}" --labels "chart--rev=${CHART}--${REV}"
----

NOTE: If you scaled down your application before initiating your backup, you can now restore your application state by running `helm upgrade`. Running this command restores your application to the state you have specified in your `values.yaml`.

[#restoring-backups]
== Restoring backups

Below are the instructions for how to restore your CircleCI server install using Velero.

[source,bash]
----
# List all existing backups
velero backup get --show-labels

# Restore the specific backup
velero restore create --include-namespaces <circleci-namespace> --from-backup <backup-name>
----

[#scheduling-backups]
== Scheduling backups

See link:https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/disaster-case/[Velero's documentation] on creating scheduled backups.

[#troubleshooting-backup]
== Troubleshooting

[#errors-occur-during-backup-or-restore-process]
=== Errors occur during backup or restore process

If you experience an error during backup or restore processes, the first place to look would be the Velero logs.
Using the command below, you may find 4XX errors, which would likely be caused by issues with your storage bucket access.

* Confirm that your bucket exists and is in the region you expect.
* Confirm that the credentials provided to Velero can be used to access the bucket.
* You may need to run the command to install Velero again, this time with updated bucket information.

You may also check the status of pods in the `velero` namespace:

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get pods --namespace velero
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
node-agent-5vlww              1/1     Pending   0          10m
node-agent-94ptv              1/1     Running   0          10m
node-agent-ch6m9              1/1     Pending   0          10m
node-agent-mknws              1/1     Running   0          10m
velero-68788b675c-dm2s7       1/1     Running   0          10m
----

In the above example, some Restic pods are pending, which means they are waiting for a node to have available CPU or memory resources. In this case, you may need to scale your nodes to accommodate Restic.
