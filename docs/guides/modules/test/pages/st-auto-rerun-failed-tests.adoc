= Auto rerun failed tests
:page-description: Automatically retry flaky tests to improve build reliability

== How it works

Auto rerun failed tests automatically detects and retries test failures during your CI run.

When you configure auto rerun:

* If a test fails, Smarter Testing automatically retries it
* Re-run happens within the same job
* The test is retried up to the configured maximum number of attempts
* Both failed and flaky test details are available under the Test tab on the job page

This eliminates the need to:

* Manually identify which jobs failed
* Manually click "rerun failed tests" workflow
