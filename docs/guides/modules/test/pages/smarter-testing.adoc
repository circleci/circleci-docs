CAUTION: *Smarter Testing* is available in preview. This means the product is in early stages and you may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or incomplete features. When the feature is made generally available, there will be a cost associated with access and usage.

Smarter Testing reduces test execution time while maintaining test confidence by:

* Running only tests that are impacted by code changes.
* Evenly distributing tests across parallel execution nodes.
* Automatically rerunning failed tests.

These features can be used independently or combined.
