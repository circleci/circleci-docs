:page-description: Automatically retry failed tests to improve build reliability

CAUTION: *Smarter Testing* is available in preview. This means the product is in early stages and you may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or incomplete features. When the feature is made generally available, there will be a cost associated with access and usage.

Auto rerun failed tests automatically detects and retries test failures during your test run. This allows you to quickly recover from flaky test failures without rerunning your entire test suite. Compared with the existing xref:rerun-failed-tests.adoc[Rerun failed tests], this elimiates the need to:

* Manually identify which jobs failed.
* Manually select the btn:[rerun failed tests] option in the CircleCI web app.

== How it works

All tests are run as normal with the `discover` and `run` command.

When automatic test rerunning is enabled:

* Any test results that failed in the JUnit XML output are rerun.
* The process is repeated until all tests are successful, or the maximum number of rerun attempts is reached.
* If all tests are successful, the errors will be suppressed and the job will succeed.
* If the maximum number of reruns is reached and there are still test failures, the job will fail.

== Prerequisites

Before enabling Auto-rerun Failed Tests, ensure you have completed the xref:getting-started-with-smarter-testing.adoc[Getting Started with Smarter Testing] guide and have:

* Installed the `testsuite` CLI plugin.
* Configured your `.circleci/test-suites.yml` with `discover` and `run` commands.
* Verified your tests run successfully with the `testsuite` command.
* Correctly configured JUnit XML output in `.circleci/test-suites.yml`.

== Configure JUnit XML output

To determine which test have failed, the test atoms from the `discover` command must match one the JUnit XML output
fields; `testname`, `classname` or `filename`.

For example; `vitest src/feature.test.ts`, `src/feature.test.ts` must exist in the JUnit XML output to determine if
it failed.

If a test cannot be matched with a result, the following warning will be output and the tests will not be rerun.

[source,console]
----
failed to match test atom with test result
----

See xref:getting-started-with-smarter-testing.adoc#3-configure-the-run-command[Configure the run command] to set up JUnit XML output.

== Auto rerun failed tests configuration options

The following options are available to be defined in the options map in your `.circleci/test-suites.yml` configuration file:

[.table-scroll]
--
[cols=3*, options="header"]
|===
|Options Field|Default|Description

|`max-auto-rerun`
|0
|The maximum number of times tests will be rerun if they fail. `max-auto-rerun` can be set in the range 0 to 10 inclusive.

When `auto-rerun-duration` is set, tests will rerun until one of the two conditions.

|`auto-rerun-duration`
|null
|The duration or percentage of total runtime tests will be rerun if they fail. e.g. `5m`, `1h`, `20%`.

When `max-auto-rerun` is set, tests will rerun until one of the two conditions.
