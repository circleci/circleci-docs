## Overview

Budget Controls help you manage and monitor your CircleCI credit usage by setting spending limits at the organization and project level. With real-time tracking and automated notifications, you can ensure your CI/CD costs stay within expected ranges while maintaining visibility across your team.

Budget Controls are available for Scale plan customers.

## What are Budget Controls?

Budget Controls allow you to:

* **Set weekly budget limits** for your entire organization or individual projects  
* **Track credit consumption** in real-time as a percentage of your budget  
* **Receive automated notifications** when you approach or reach budget thresholds

Budgets run on weekly cycles from Monday 00:00 UTC through Sunday 23:59:59 UTC and reset automatically each week.

## Prerequisites

To use Budget Controls, you need:

* A CircleCI Scale plan  
* Organization Admin permissions to create, edit, or delete budgets  
* Access to the Plans page to view budget status

## What counts towards budgets?

Your budget limits track credits consumed across:

* **Compute usage** \- All execution environments (Docker, machine, macOS, Windows, GPU, Arm)  
* **Docker Layer Caching (DLC)** \- Caching for Docker image layers  
* **Storage costs** \- Artifact and workspace storage  
* **IP ranges** \- Static IP address usage  
* **Network usage** \- Data transfer costs

**Note:** User seat charges are excluded from budget limits, as these are fixed organizational costs rather than consumption-based project work.
