NOTE: Budget controls are available for Scale Plan customers.

Budget controls help you manage and monitor your CircleCI credit usage by setting spending limits at the organization and project level. With real-time tracking and automated notifications, you can ensure your CI/CD costs stay within expected ranges while maintaining visibility across your team.

== What are budget controls?

Budget controls allow you to:

* **Set weekly budget limits** for your entire organization or individual projects.
* **Track credit consumption** in real-time as a percentage of your budget.
* **Receive automated notifications** when you approach or reach budget thresholds.

Budgets run on weekly cycles from Monday 00:00 UTC through Sunday 23:59:59 UTC and reset automatically each week.

== What counts towards budgets?

NOTE: User seat charges are excluded from budget limits, as these are fixed organizational costs rather than consumption-based project work.

Your budget limits track credits consumed across:

* **Compute usage** for all execution environments (Docker, machine, macOS, Windows, GPU, Arm).
* **Docker Layer Caching (DLC)** usage.
* **Storage costs** for artifact and workspace storage.
* **IP ranges** usage, to restrict traffic to specific IP ranges.
* **Network usage**, data transfer costs.

== Prerequisites

To use Budget Controls, you need:

* A CircleCI Scale Plan.
* Organization administrator permissions to create, edit, or delete budgets.
* Access to the Plans page to view budget status.
