This document describes the Server Plan available to developers.

[#server-plan]
== Server Plan
CircleCI server is an on-premises CI/CD platform for enterprise customers who have compliance or security needs that require operation:

* Within a firewall.
* In a private cloud.
* In a data center.

See the xref:server-admin:overview:circleci-server-overview.adoc[Server documentation] for more information.

The Server Plan offers custom credit options that can be used across all CircleCI resource classes, per month, depending on your build configuration and execution environment.

The Server Plan gives you access to a few additional upgrades over some of the other plans:

[#custom-user-seat-count]
=== Custom user seat count
Customize the number of active users based on your needs.

[#custom-storage-retention]
=== Custom storage retention
The link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] allows for the customization of the storage retention periods of artifact, workspace, and cache objects. This allows you to determine how to store each of these objects types in a way that best suits your project. Lowering storage retention periods can also reduce your monthly bill.

[#additional-support-options]
=== Additional support options
Additional support through expanded SLAs, an available account team, training and onboarding options, all of which are expandable with available support package add-ons. The Server Plan also has access to the link:https://discuss.circleci.com/[community forums], link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us[support portal], and our link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[global ticket-based system].
