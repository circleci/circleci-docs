:page-description: Use outbound webhooks to integrate with third-party services and subscribe to CircleCI events
:experimental:


Setting up an **outbound webhook** on CircleCI enables your third party service to receive information (referred to as _events_) from CircleCI, as they happen. This can help you avoid polling the API or manually checking the CircleCI web application for desired information.

== Introduction
Use outbound webhooks to integrate your CircleCI builds with external services.

For example, you could use outbound webhooks to:

* Build a custom dashboard to visualize or analyze workflow/job events.
* Send data to incident management tools (such as link:https://www.pagerduty.com[PagerDuty]).
* Use tools like xref:webhooks-airtable.adoc[Airtable] to capture data and visualize it.
* Alert when a workflow is cancelled, then use the API to rerun the workflow.
* Trigger notification systems to alert people when workflows/jobs complete.
* Build your own automation plugins and tools.

The following sections detail CircleCI outbound webhook structure and protocols.

== Quickstart

NOTE: Projects are limited to 5 outbound webhooks.

Webhooks are set up on a per-project basis, either within the CircleCI app or via API.

To configure webhooks via API see our documentation for https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Webhook[Webhooks Public API].

To configure webhooks within the CircleCI app:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select your organization.
. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis image:guides:ROOT:icons/more.svg[more icon, role="no-border"], and select **Project Settings**.
. In the sidebar select *Webhooks*
. Select *Add Webhook*
. Fill out the webhook form (the table below describes the fields and their intent)
. If your receiving API or third party service is set up, select *Test Ping Event* to send a test event.
+
NOTE: The test ping event has an abbreviated payload for ease of testing. See full examples for xref:reference:ROOT:outbound-webhooks-reference.adoc#sample-webhook-payloads[sample webhook payloads] section of the webhooks reference.

[cols="2,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Required? | Intent

| Webhook name
| Y
| The name of your webhook

| URL
| Y
| The URL the webhook will make POST requests to

| Certificate Validation
| Y
| Ensure the receiving host has a valid SSL certificate before sending an event. You should only leave this unchecked for testing purposes.

| Secret token
| N
| Used by your API/platform to validate incoming data is from CircleCI

| Select an event
| Y
| You must select at least one event that will trigger a webhook
|===

[#communication-protocol]
== Communication protocol for outbound webhooks

Once set up, a webhook is sent whenever an event occurs on the CircleCI platform.

A webhook is sent using an HTTP POST to the URL that was registered when the webhook was created, with a body encoded using JSON.

CircleCI expects the server that responds to a webhook will return a 2xx response code. If a non-2xx response is received, CircleCI will retry at a later time. If CircleCI does not receive a response to the webhook within a short period of time, CircleCI will assume that delivery has failed, and will retry at a later time. The timeout period is currently 10 seconds.

Webhook requests may be duplicated. To deduplicate (prevent requests from being duplicated for a specific event), use the xref:reference:ROOT:outbound-webhooks-reference.adoc#common-top-level-keys[`id` property] in the webhook payload for identification.

If you have feedback about timeouts and retries, link:https://circleci.canny.io/webhooks[get in touch] with our team.

[#headers]
=== Outbound webhook headers

A number of HTTP headers are set on webhooks, as detailed in the table below.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Header name | Value

| `content-type`
| `application/json`

| `user-agent`
| A string indicating that the sender was CircleCI (`CircleCI-Webhook/1.0`).

| `circleci-event-type`
| The type of event, (`workflow-completed`, `job-completed`, etc)

| `circleci-signature`
| When present, this signature can be used to verify that the sender of the webhook has access to the secret token.
|===

[#validate-webhooks]
== Validate outbound webhooks

You should validate webhooks as they come in to third party services to verify that they are coming from CircleCI. To support this, when creating a webhook, you can optionally provide a secret token. Each outgoing HTTP request to your service will contain a `circleci-signature` header. This header will consist of a comma-separated list of versioned signatures.

[,shell]
----
POST /uri HTTP/1.1
Host: your-webhook-host
circleci-signature: v1=4fcc06915b43d8a49aff193441e9e18654e6a27c2c428b02e8fcc41ccc2299f9,v2=...,v3=...
----

Currently, the latest (and only) signature version is v1. You should _only_ check the latest signature type to prevent downgrade attacks.

The v1 signature is the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body, using the configured signing secret as the secret key.

Here are some example signatures for given request bodies:

[cols=3*, options="header"]
|===
| Body | Secret Key | Signature

| `hello world`
| `secret`
| `734cc62f32841568f45715aeb9f4d7891324e6d948e4c6c60c0621cdac48623a`

| `lalala`
| `another-secret`
| `daa220016c8f29a8b214fbfc3671aeec2145cfb1e6790184ffb38b6d0425fa00`

| `an-important-request-payload`
| `hunter123`
| `9be2242094a9a8c00c64306f382a7f9d691de910b4a266f67bd314ef18ac49fa`
|===

The following is an example of how you might validate signatures in Python:

[,python]
----
import hmac

def verify_signature(secret, headers, body):
    # get the v1 signature from the `circleci-signature` header
    signature_from_header = {
        k: v for k, v in [
            pair.split('=') for pair in headers['circleci-signature'].split(',')
        ]
    }['v1']

    # Run HMAC-SHA256 on the request body using the configured signing secret
    valid_signature = hmac.new(bytes(secret, 'utf-8'), bytes(body, 'utf-8'), 'sha256').hexdigest()

    # use constant time string comparison to prevent timing attacks
    return hmac.compare_digest(valid_signature, signature_from_header)

# the following will return `True`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=773ba44693c7553d6ee20f61ea5d2757a9a4f4a44d2841ae4e95b52e4cd62db4'
    },
    'foo',
)

# the following will return `False`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=not-a-valid-signature'
    },
    'foo',
)
