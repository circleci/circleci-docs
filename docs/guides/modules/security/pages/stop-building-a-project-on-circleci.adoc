If you are using the GitHub OAuth App or Bitbucket Cloud, to stop building one of your projects on CircleCI, follow these steps:

. Go to the **Project Settings** page in the CircleCI web app for the project you want to stop.
. Scroll to the bottom of the Overview page and select **Stop Building**. You will need to reconfirm your choice in the popup.

NOTE: If you want to start building this project again, just go to the **Projects** page in the web app and select **Set Up Project** and follow the set up steps.
