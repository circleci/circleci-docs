:page-description: "A guide to the various ways to manage pipeline triggering in CircleCI"
:experimental:

Pipelines are triggered in response to actions or scheduled to run at specific times and frequencies. Each method of triggering a pipeline is described below.

[#run-a-pipeline-on-commit-to-your-code-repository]
== Trigger a pipeline on a repo event

Trigger a pipeline on an event in your repository. The options available to you will be different depending on which integration you have set up, and for GitHub accounts, which GitHub authentication method you use. For steps to add a trigger for a project, see the xref:set-up-triggers.adoc[Set up triggers] page.

Once triggered, a running pipeline appears on the pipelines dashboard, which is accessible by selecting **Pipelines** from the left hand sidebar in the CircleCI web app. This option is called *Dashboard* if you are using CircleCI server.

[#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app]
== Trigger a pipeline from the CircleCI web app

NOTE: This feature is not available for GitLab integrations.

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home[CircleCI web app], select your organization from your homepage, then select your project, either from your org homepage or select **Projects** from the sidebar for a full list. You will now be on your project's pipelines page.

. Select btn:[Trigger Pipeline].

. Select the pipeline you want to trigger from the dropdown menu.

. Select your config source branch. This tells CircleCI where (repo and branch) to find your pipeline config.
+
image::guides:ROOT:trigger-pipeline-app-modal.png[Trigger a pipeline modal in the CircleCI web app]

. If your code is integrated via the **GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center**, select your checkout source and branch. This tells CircleCI which code to check out when running a xref:reference:ROOT:configuration-reference.adoc#checkout[`checkout` step].
+
TIP: If your code is integrated via **GitHub OAuth or Bitbucket Cloud**, you can skip this step, the same location is used for both config and checkout source.

. If you would like to specify any pipeline parameters, select **Add +** and enter the required fields.

. Select **Run Pipeline** and you will see your new pipeline running in the web app.

NOTE: If your GitHub user account connection to CircleCI is not yet authorized, you will need to select btn:[Authorize] in the trigger pipeline modal to connect and continue.

[#run-a-pipeline-using-the-api]
== Trigger a pipeline using the API

NOTE: Triggering a pipeline via the CircleCI v2 API is not currently supported for GitLab projects.

[tabs]
====
GitHub and Bitbucket::
+
--
This method is supported for GitHub (OAuth and App) and Bitbucket (Cloud and Data Center) orgs.

TIP: **GitHub OAuth and Bitbucket Cloud pipelines** can also be triggered using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[Trigger a New Pipeline] endpoint, which is described in the **CircleCI server** tab. However, the method outlined in this section is recommended.

Trigger a pipeline for a project using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#tag/Pipeline/operation/triggerPipelineRun[v2 API endpoint] `https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<project-slug>/pipeline/run`.

. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  xref:toolkit:api-developers-guide#authentication-and-authorization[API Developers Guide].

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[CircleCI web app] select your organization. Over the next few steps you will collect the data you need to trigger your pipeline.

. Find your project slug:
.. Select **Projects** in the CircleCI web app sidebar.
.. Find your project.
.. Select the ellipsis menu image:guides:ROOT:icons/more.svg[more icon, role="no-border"] and choose **Project Settings**.
.. Copy your project slug. Save this somewhere, you will need it later.

. Find your definition ID:
.. You should be in project settings if you are following these steps in sequence. If not see previous steps to get there. Select **Pipelines** in the sidebar.
.. In the column **Definition ID**, select btn:[Copy] for the correct pipeline. Save this somewhere, you will need it in the next step.
+
image::guides:ROOT:triggers/copy-pipeline-definition-id.png[screenshot showing location of pipeline definition ID copy button]

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details. The key `parameters` is optional:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<project-slug>/pipeline/run \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "definition_id": "<pipeline-definition-id>",
  "config": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "checkout": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "parameters": {"<param-name>": "<param-value>"}
  }'
----

. To run a pipeline based on a **tag** instead of a **branch**, replace the `config` and/or `checkout` fields with:
+
[source,shell]
----
  "config": {"tag": "<your-tag-name>"},
  "checkout": {"tag": "<your-tag-name>"}
----
. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.
--
CircleCI server::
+
--
. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  xref:toolkit:api-developers-guide.adoc#authentication-and-authorization[API Developers Guide].

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details, VCS can be `gh` or `bb`:
+
NOTE: If you are using CircleCI cloud, `<your-circleci-hostname>` should be `circleci.com`.
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://<your-circleci-hostname>/api/v2/project/<VCS>/<your-vcs-org-or-username>/<your-repo-name>/pipeline \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"branch":"<your-branch-name>"}'
----

. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.

TIP: You can also specify pipeline parameters when triggering a pipeline using the API. For full details, see the https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[API v2 Docs].

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-a-custom-webhook]
== Trigger a pipeline from a custom webhook

NOTE: Custom webhooks are available for projects integrated via the GitHub App. Custom webhooks are not available on CircleCI server.

Follow these steps to set up and test a custom webhook trigger for a pipeline from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command:

include::ROOT:partial$pipelines-and-triggers/custom-webhook-setup.adoc[]

. You can now test your custom webhook trigger with `curl`. To trigger your pipeline, copy and paste the following sample request and replace `<your-URL>` and `<your-secret>` with the URL and secret that you generated in the previous step:
+
NOTE: When triggering via `curl`, you must use a `POST` request with `content-type: application/json`.
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" 'https://internal.circleci.com/private/soc/e/<your-URL>?secret=<your-secret>'
----

For more information on using custom and outbound webhooks, see the xref:custom-webhooks.adoc[Custom webhooks] and xref:integration:outbound-webhooks.adoc[Outbound webhooks] pages. Also, see our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-pipelines-from-anywhere-inbound-webhooks-now-in-preview/49864[community forum] for more details or how to use this functionality with a link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/re-build-automatically-when-new-image-is-available-on-dockerhub/50350[3rd party service like DockerHub].

****
When handling custom webhook requests, we use the "config branch" and "checkout branch" fields (`config_ref` and `checkout_ref` in the API) to determine which commits should be used for config and code checkout. This information is retrieved from link:https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-commit[GitHub's API].

GitHub does not provide documented consistency guarantees for their API responses. There can be a brief delay (typically seconds) between when a commit is pushed and when the API returns the updated reference, especially with larger repositories. As a result, when fetching a branch reference, you may receive a slightly outdated commit rather than the most recent one.

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-vs-code-with-unversioned-config]
== Trigger a pipeline from VS Code with unversioned config

NOTE: The ability to trigger a pipeline from VS Code with an _unversioned_ config is currently in **Open Preview**.

Trigger pipelines from VS Code to iterate on your CircleCI config without committing your trial and error changes to your version control system. Run and validate your full pipeline, or select jobs and workflows to validate individually. View the results of your test runs in the extension pipelines panel or in the CircleCI web app, just the same as any other pipeline.

For full details, see the xref:toolkit:vs-code-extension-overview.adoc#test-run-your-config-from-vs-code[VS Code extension overview].

image::guides:ROOT:vscode-ext-config-test-run-crop.png[Screenshot showing the run panel]

[#schedule-a-pipeline]
== Schedule a pipeline

NOTE: Schedule triggers are not available for GitLab and Bitbucket Data Center pipelines.

Schedule triggers allow you to trigger pipelines periodically based on a schedule. To get this set up for a project you can either use the CircleCI web app or use the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/createSchedule[API v2]. For full details of both methods see the xref:schedule-triggers.adoc[Schedule Triggers] docs.
