:page-description: Configure automatic reruns for failed workflows to reduce manual intervention and improve pipeline reliability
:experimental:

Automatic reruns help reduce the impact of temporary failures in your CI/CD pipeline. When a workflow fails due to transient issues, CircleCI can automatically restart the failed workflow without manual intervention.

Common use cases include:

* Handling flaky tests.
* Managing unreliable infrastructure or network connectivity problems.
* Working with spot instances that may be terminated unexpectedly.
* Preventing merge queue delays caused by transient failures.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Automatic reruns provide a safety net for your CI/CD pipelines by automatically retrying failed workflows. This feature helps teams maintain productivity by reducing the need for manual intervention when workflows fail due to temporary issues.

The feature works by monitoring workflow completion status and automatically triggering a "rerun from failed" operation when <<rerun-criteria,specific conditions are met>>. This ensures that only failed jobs and their dependencies are retried, while successful jobs from the original workflow are not repeated.

Benefits of automatic workflow reruns include:

* Reduced manual intervention for transient failures.
* Improved pipeline reliability and developer productivity.
* Cost-effective retry strategy that only reruns failed jobs.
* Configurable retry limits to prevent infinite loops.

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

To enable automatic reruns for a workflow, add the `max_auto_reruns` key to your workflow with a value between 1 and 5:

.CircleCI config to automatically retry my-workflow up to 3 times if it fails
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

workflows:
  my-workflow:
    max_auto_reruns: 3
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build
            - test
----

You can combine automatic reruns with workflow conditions. The following example shows how to configure automatic reruns for a workflow that is not triggered by a scheduled pipeline:

.Combining automatic reruns with workflow conditions
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

workflows:
  test-workflow:
    when:
      not:
        equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
    max_auto_reruns: 4
    jobs:
      - build
      - test

[#how-automatic-reruns-work]
== How automatic reruns work

Automatic workflow reruns function similarly to manually clicking "Rerun workflow from failed" in the CircleCI interface. When a workflow fails, CircleCI evaluates whether the workflow qualifies for automatic rerun based on specific criteria, as described in the following section.

[#rerun-criteria]
=== Rerun criteria

For automatic reruns to trigger, all of the following conditions must be met:

* The workflow status is "failed".
* The `max_auto_reruns` value is specified in the configuration.
* The number of remaining rerun attempts is greater than zero, and less than or equal to the specified `max_auto_reruns` value.
* The workflow is not a manual rerun.
* The pipeline is not older than 90 days.

[#rerun-behavior]
=== Rerun behavior

When an automatic rerun is triggered:

* Only failed jobs from the original workflow are retried. If the previous failure blocked dependent jobs from running, these jobs are also run.
* Successfully completed jobs are not rerun.
* The rerun uses the same actor permissions as the original workflow.

[#monitoring-automatic-reruns]
== Monitoring automatic reruns

CircleCI provides several ways to monitor and track automatic rerun activity.

[#ui-indicators]
=== UI indicators

Automatic reruns are indicated on the pipelines page in the CircleCI web app. In the Trigger event column you sill see *Auto-rerun* followed by the rerun attempt number, as shown in the following screenshot.

In this example the workflow is rerun twice out of a possible five attempts before it succeeds.

=== Get details via the API

You can retrieve information about automatic reruns using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#tag/Workflow/operation/getWorkflowById[CircleCI API]:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "https://circleci.com/api/v2/workflow/{workflow-id}" \
  -H "Circle-Token: YOUR_TOKEN"
----

The API response includes additional fields for automatic reruns:

* `auto_rerun_number`: The current rerun attempt number.
* `max_auto_reruns`: The maximum number of reruns configured.

[#limitations]
== Limitations

Be aware of these limitations when using automatic workflow reruns:

* Maximum rerun attempts are capped at 5 per workflow.
* Only the original workflow triggers automatic reruns. Manual reruns do not trigger automatic reruns.
* Automatic reruns are disabled if the pipeline is older than 90 days.
* Only failed workflows trigger automatic reruns, not cancelled workflows.

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for automatic workflow reruns.

[#reruns-not-triggering]
=== Reruns not triggering

If automatic reruns are not starting, check these conditions:

* Verify `max_auto_reruns` is specified in your workflow configuration.
* Ensure the workflow status is "failed" and not "cancelled".
* Confirm the maximum rerun attempts have not been exceeded.
* Check that the workflow was not manually rerun.
* Verify the pipeline is less than 90 days old.

[source,yaml]
----
# Correct configuration
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    max_auto_reruns: 3  # Must be present
    jobs:
      - build
----

[#excessive-reruns]
=== Excessive rerun attempts

To prevent unnecessary reruns and credit consumption:

* Set conservative `max_auto_reruns` values based on your failure patterns.
* Investigate recurring failures to address root causes.
* Monitor rerun patterns to optimize configuration.

[#configuration-errors]
=== Configuration errors

Common configuration mistakes include:

* Setting `max_auto_reruns` greater than 5 (results in configuration error).
* Placing `max_auto_reruns` at the job level instead of workflow level.

[source,yaml]
----
# Incorrect - job level
jobs:
  build:
    max_auto_reruns: 3  # Wrong placement
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.04

# Correct - workflow level
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    max_auto_reruns: 3  # Correct placement
    jobs:
      - build

[#frequently-asked-questions]
== Frequently asked questions

[#faq-cost]
=== Do automatic reruns consume additional credits?

Yes, automatic reruns consume compute credits for each retry attempt. Only failed jobs are rerun, so successful jobs from the original workflow do not consume additional credits.

[#faq-manual-rerun]
=== What happens if I manually rerun a workflow?

If you manually rerun a workflow and it fails, no automatic reruns will be triggered for the manually rerun workflow.

[#faq-approval-jobs]
=== Do automatic reruns work with approval jobs?

Yes.

[#faq-contexts]
=== Do automatic reruns work with restricted contexts?

Yes, automatic reruns use the same actor permissions as the original workflow, so they work with restricted contexts as long as the original workflow had the necessary permissions.

[#faq-delay]
=== Can I add a delay between automatic reruns?

Automatic reruns start immediately after the workflow fails.

[#faq-step-level]
=== Can I configure automatic reruns at the step level?

NOTE: Step-level configuration for automatic reruns will be supported soon.

Automatic reruns are configured at the workflow level.
