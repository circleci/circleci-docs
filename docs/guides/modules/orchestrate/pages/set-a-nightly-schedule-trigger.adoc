= Set a nightly schedule trigger

:page-description: "Learn how to create schedule triggers on a specific timetable."

:page-aliases: set-a-nightly-scheduled-pipeline.adoc

NOTE: Schedule triggers are not currently available for GitLab and Bitbucket Data Center projects.

A common scenario you might want to set up is to trigger a pipeline overnight. The examples below shows how to schedule a pipeline to be run at midnight every night. You can set a schedule right from the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app], or if you would prefer, you can set one using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html[API].

[#set-a-in-the-web-app]
== Set a schedule in the web app

To access the form for specifying a schedule for a trigger, follow the steps below for your pipeline type.

For a nightly schedule, you will need to take into account the form uses UTC (coordinated universal time). For example, if you would like your pipeline to trigger at midnight (0:00) in eastern standard time (EST), you would need to find the difference from UTC. In this scenario, 0:00 EST is 5:00 UTC.

[#set-a-schedule-with-the-api]
== Set a schedule with the API

NOTE: Setting up a schedule trigger with the API is not currently available for GitHub App pipelines.

To set a schedule with the API, you will need a project building on CircleCI, environment variables set, and your CircleCI personal API token. Much like in the web app form, you are required to enter a name, parameters (like the branch or tag) as well as a timetable.

```javascript
const axios = require('axios').default;
require('dotenv').config()

// environment variables
const API_BASE_URL = "https://circleci.com/api/v2/project"
const vcs = process.env.VCS_TYPE
const org = process.env.ORG_NAME
const project = process.env.PROJECT_ID
const token = process.env.CIRCLE_TOKEN

const postScheduleEndpoint = `${API_BASE_URL}/${vcs}/${org}/${project}/schedule`

async function setupNightlySchedule(){
  let res = await axios.post(postScheduleEndpoint,
    {
      name: "Nightly build",
      description: "Builds and pushes a new build every night.",
        "attribution-actor": "system",
        "parameters": {
          "branch": "main",
          "run-schedule": true
        },
        "timetable": {
            // once per hour
            "per-hour": 1,
            // at 01:00 UTC
            "hours-of-day": [1],
            // on the following days of the week
            "days-of-week": ["TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT"]
        }
    },
    {
      headers: { 'Circle-Token': token }
    }
  )
  console.log(res.data)
}

setupNightlySchedule()
```
