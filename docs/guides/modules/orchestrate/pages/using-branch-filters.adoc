== Branch-filtering to control when job steps will run

Branch filtering has previously only been available for workflows, but with compile-time logic statements, you can also implement branch filtering for job steps.

The following example shows using the <<pipeline-variables#pipeline-values,pipeline value>> `pipeline.git.branch` to control `when` a step should run. In this case the step `run: echo "I am on main"` only runs when the commit is on the main branch:

include::ROOT:partial$notes/docker-auth.adoc[]

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  my-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - when:
          condition:
            equal: [ main, << pipeline.git.branch >> ]
          steps:
            - run: echo "I am on main"

workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - my-job
```
