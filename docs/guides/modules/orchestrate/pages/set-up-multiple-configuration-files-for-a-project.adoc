= Set up multiple configuration files for a project
:page-platform: Cloud
:page-description: A step by step guide for setting up multiple pipelines, each defined in a separate configuration file, in a CircleCI project.
:experimental:

A CircleCI project integrated with GitHub can have one or more pipelines, each defined by a separate configuration file. CircleCI configuration files can be stored in the same repo as your code, or even in different repos if you wish.

Each pipeline can be configured to run on one or many specific trigger events.

If your existing configuration file is getting too large to manage, and it includes several unrelated workflows, consider splitting it into more than one file.

Using multiple pipelines and triggers, you can build different pipelines for different events, For example, you could have:

- A `build-test` pipeline that runs on every push. Select "All pushes".
- A `e2e-tests` pipeline, longer and more costly, that runs once when the PR is taken out of draft. Select "PR marked ready for review".
- A `teardown-env` pipeline that runs when a PR is merged. Select "PR merged".

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To use multiple pipelines and configs for a project in CircleCI, you will need to meet the following prerequisites:

* A CircleCI account connected to your code in GitHub. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free]. Any of CircleCI's GitHub integrations are supported, read our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-update-using-github-app-functionality-in-a-github-oauth-app-organization/52204/1[community forum] for background on how this functionality can be used with an org integrated CircleCI's GitHub OAuth App. To use multiple pipelines for a project you will use the xref:integration:github-apps-integration.adoc[CircleCI GitHub App integration].
* A project set up in CircleCI that you want to configure with multiple, distinct pipelines defined with different configuration files. See the xref:getting-started:create-project.adoc[Create a project in CircleCI] page for steps to get your project set up in CircleCI.

[#add-additional-config-file]
== 1. Add additional configuration files to your project repository

To use more than one configuration for your project you will create more than one pipeline. You can set up separate triggers for each pipeline. Each pipeline is defined by a YAML config file.

In this first step, create the configs you need to build your project. Config files can be stored anywhere you choose within your GitHub org. This can be in the same repo, or a different repo. Your configuration files can have any name you choose, but must have the `.yml` extension.

If your project is already set up in CircleCI, a configuration file will likely exist already. If you do not see a `.circleci` directory containing a YAML config, check which branch you are on. You may have set this up on a non-default branch during the set up process.

Each of your configuration files represents the full set of commands necessary for a pipeline to execute so it should be complete with all necessary elements, for example, `version`, `jobs`, `workflows`, `commands`, `executors`, `orbs` etc.

NOTE: **Splitting up an existing configuration?** If you are following these steps because you have an existing project building on CircleCI and you want to split your configuration into multiple files, you can create the config files you need and move over parts of your existing configuration file to your new YAML files.

== 2. Set up a pipeline

Next, add a new pipeline for each config you have. Create and edit pipeline in your menu:Project Settings[Project Setup].

include::ROOT:partial$app-navigation/steps-to-project-settings.adoc[]
. Select **Project Setup** in the sidebar.
+
. Select btn:[Add Pipeline].
+
NOTE: If you have not installed the CircleCI GitHub App into your GitHub organization you will be prompted to do so. Installing the GitHub App is a one-time step that can be done by an organization admin. Once installed, further GitHub App pipelines can be setup without this installation step. For a guide to using both OAuth and GitHub App integrations, see the xref:integration:using-the-circleci-github-app-in-an-oauth-org.adoc[Using the CircleCI GitHub App in an OAuth organization] page. If you run into issues when installing the GitHub App, for example, App looks installed on GitHub, but does not show up on CircleCI, submit a request through link:https://forms.gle/aaVERZNNvzsDLJJ46[this form].
. Complete the required form fields:
** Give your pipeline a descriptive name.
** Under *Config Source* select the repository where the config file is stored. This can be the same repository as your code or a different repository.
** Specify where your config file is located under **Config File Path**.
** Select your code source under **Checkout Source** -- this is the code that will be checked out when using the xref:reference:ROOT:configuration-reference.adoc#checkout[`checkout` step] in your config file.
. Select btn:[Save]

[#create-a-new-trigger]
== 3. Create a new trigger

Next, create a trigger for each pipeline you have created for your project. Alternatively, you can trigger a pipeline manually xref:triggers-overview.adoc#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app[via the web app].

. Following from the previous step, select btn:[GitHub trigger +] at the bottom of the pipeline box.
. Choose when to run the pipeline by selecting an option from the *Event* menu.
. Select the *Event Source* repository from the dropdown. This defaults to the config source repository. If you change it to a repository that does not match the pipeline's config or checkout source, you will be prompted to specify a fixed branch to be used for fetching config and checking out code.

. Select btn:[Save]

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

You should now have more than one CircleCI config file for your project, each config connected to a separate pipeline, and each pipeline connected to a trigger, as required.
