:experimental:

The CircleCI web application is a graphic user interface for managing your projects, pipelines, settings, integrations and organizations. The application can be found at link:https://app.circleci.com[https://app.circleci.com].

Inside the application, you will find the features including the following:

* Status of pipelines, workflows and jobs.
* Controls for rerunning, cancelling, approving workflows.
* Access to job step output and logs.
* Organization and project settings.
* Insights for managing your projects and organizations.
* Deploys UI viewing and managing your deployments.
* Self-hosted runner setup and management.

This page is not an exhaustive guide to the web app, but is an introduction to some of the information, options, and settings available.

Some settings and functionality described in on this page, including the in-app configuration editor, are currently not available for `circleci` type organizations. For an overview of feature availability for each organization/integration type, see the xref:integration:version-control-system-integration-overview.adoc[VCS integration overview] page.

== Organization homepage and navigation

After selecting an organization you will find yourself on the Organization homepage, or Dashboard if you are using CircleCI server. The organization homepage provides an overview of your org's projects, project health metrics, and compute and credit usage metrics for your org.

image::guides:ROOT:org-homepage.png[Organization homepage]

TIP: Once you have selected an org, you can select the btn:[CircleCI] logo in the top bar to get back to your user homepage at any time.

From your organization home page you have access to org-level options. You can create a project, select and existing project using the overview project cards, or use the sidebar navigation items to access other areas of the product. The sidebar navigation allows you to visit the following pages (some of these sections are discussed in more detail below):

**Pipelines**: View all pipelines associated with your organization, You can expand each pipeline to view workflow status, job status, job details, the workflows map, and more. Each pipeline includes controls for cancelling or rerunning workflows, and accessing project settings. Multi-workflow pipelines display a grey bar to the left. You can see the status of each workflow and expand them individually to view the status of each job.

**Projects**: Allows you to see all projects associated with your organization. Choose to follow or unfollow projects, as well as xref:getting-started:create-project.adoc[create/set up new projects].

**Deploys**: Set up environment integrations to manage deployments for your projects. For full details of the deployments feature, see the xref:deploy:deployment-overview.adoc[Deployment overview] page.

**Insights**: Provides you with time-series data overviews of credit usage, success rates, pipeline duration, and more. For full details of the Insights feature, see the xref:insights:insights.adoc[Using Insights] page.

**Self-Hosted Runners**: Set up self-hosted runners to use your own infrastructure for running jobs. Once set up the self-hosted runners dashboard displays a list of your resource classes and self-hosted runners. For full details covering installation, setup, and usage, see the xref:execution-runner:runner-overview.adoc[Self-hosted runners overview] page.

**Organization Settings**: Settings for your organization including org roles and groups, contexts, security, orbs and more. You can find your organization ID on this page.

**Plan**: Displays your network and storage usage, as well as additional settings related to your plan.

The sections below describe some of the pages of the web application in more detail.

=== Pipelines dashboard

Select **Pipelines** in the sidebar to enter the pipelines dashboard. By default, the pipeline dashboard displays the workflow status for all pipelines for all the projects that you are _following_. Use the filters at the top of the page to view the following:

* All pipelines.
* Just your pipelines.
* Pipelines for a specific project, and within this a specific branch.
* Pipelines triggered before a specific day range, for example "Greater than 90 days". This can be helpful when analyzing historical data, as it allows you to filter out and focus on older pipelines without having to scroll through a large amount of data.
* Use the filter icon to restrict the workflow statuses that you are interested in viewing. For example if you only want to see pipelines with workflows that are "Failed" and "Needs Approval", you can select those options from the filter menu.

If you are missing specific projects from the pipelines dashboard, you can select **Projects** on the side navigation. The projects view displays a list of all projects within the organization, which you can choose to follow or unfollow. Following a project will add it to your dashboard. Unfollowing a project will remove it from your dashboard.

[#view-and-navigate-pipelines]
== View and navigate pipelines

Your pipelines appear on the **Pipelines** dashboard of the CircleCI web app as they are triggered. You can view workflows or single jobs by expanding a pipeline and clicking on any workflow or job descriptor.

When viewing a single job in a pipeline, you can use the breadcrumbs at the top of the page to navigate back to a job's respective workflow or pipeline.

image::guides:ROOT:pipeline-navigation.png[Pipeline navigation]

[#organization-switching]
== Organization switching

If you want to change which org you are working within, you have a few options:

* Select the btn:[CircleCI] logo in the top bar to get back to your user homepage at any time (1). From the user home page you can select the org that you want to work in. You can also create a new organization from your user home page.
* Once in an org view you can also use the org switcher at the top of the sidebar (2).

image::guides:ROOT:org-switch.png[Switch organization using the user homepage or the org switcher]

If you do not see your project and it is not currently building on CircleCI, check your org in the top left corner of the CircleCI application. For example, if the top left displays your user `my-user`, only projects belonging to `my-user` will be available. If you want to add the project `your-org/project`, you must select `your-org` from the org switcher.

[#projects]
== Projects

TIP: The options available to you will be different depending on how you xref:integration:version-control-system-integration-overview.adoc[integrate your code] with CircleCI.

Projects associated with your organization appear on the **Projects** page. You have the option to:

* xref:getting-started:create-project.adoc#create-a-project[Create a project]
* xref:getting-started:create-project.adoc#set-up-a-project[Set Up any project] that you are the owner of in your VCS.
* _Follow_ any project in your organization to gain access to its pipelines on the pipelines page and to subscribe to xref:integration:notifications.adoc[email notifications] for the project's status.
* _Unfollow_ a project to removes it from your Pipelines page and unsubscribe from notifications.

Select the ellipsis menu icon image:guides:ROOT:icons/more.svg[more icon, role="no-border"] in a project row to access project assets, as follows:

* Configuration file in the config editor.
