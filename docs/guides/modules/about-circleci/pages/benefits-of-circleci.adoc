== Benefits of CircleCI

Organizations choose CircleCI because jobs run fast and builds can be optimized for speed. CircleCI can be configured to run very complex pipelines efficiently with sophisticated xref:optimize:caching.adoc[caching], xref:optimize:docker-layer-caching.adoc[Docker layer caching], and xref:optimize:optimizations.adoc#resource-class[resource classes] for running on faster machines.

As a developer using CircleCI you can:

- xref:execution-managed:ssh-access-jobs.adoc[SSH into any job] to debug your build issues.
- Set up xref:optimize:parallelism-faster-jobs.adoc[parallelism] in your `.circleci/config.yml` file to run test jobs faster.
- Configure xref:optimize:caching.adoc[caching] with two simple keys to reuse data from previous jobs in your xref:orchestrate:workflows.adoc[workflow].
- Configure self-hosted xref:execution-runner:runner-overview.adoc[runners] for unique platform support.
- Access xref:execution-managed:using-arm.adoc[Arm VM resources] and xref:execution-managed:using-docker.adoc#arm[Arm on Docker].
- Use xref:orbs:use:orb-intro.adoc[orbs], reusable packages of configuration, to integrate with third parties.
- Use pre-built Docker xref:execution-managed:circleci-images.adoc[images] in a variety of languages.
- Use the link:https://www.circleci.com/docs/api/v2/[API] to retrieve information about jobs and workflows.
- Use the xref:toolkit:local-cli.adoc[CLI] to access advanced tools locally.
- Get flaky test detection with xref:insights:insights-tests.adoc[test insights].

As an operator or administrator of CircleCI installed on your own servers, CircleCI provides monitoring and insights into your builds and uses link:https://www.nomadproject.io/[Nomad] for scheduling.

See the xref:server-admin:overview:circleci-server-overview.adoc[CircleCI server overview] for server documentation.
