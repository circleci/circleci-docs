[#overview]
== Overview

Use CircleCI test Insights to analyze your test performance within the most recent executions and identify opportunities for test optimization. To access test insights, select the *Tests* tab on the *Workflow Insights* page.

The next sections go over what test insights are available.

[#performance-summary]
=== Performance summary

The summary section displays test suite performance across your most recent 100 runs. You can view the following:

* Average test per run
* Number of all flaky tests detected
* Failure counts
* Slow run times in test suite

[#most-recent-runs]
=== Most recent runs

The most recent runs chart displays the most recent 100 executions of the test suite. You can hover over each bar to review the following:

* Test count
* Skipped tests
* Success rate of tests

[#flaky-tests]
=== Flaky tests

Flaky tests are tests that fail non-deterministically; they pass and fail due to some state external to the repository. As a result, flaky tests introduce uncertainty to a project's build state.

Test Insights detects flaky tests. Flaky tests are identified as tests that failed and passed on the same commit in a 14-day window. Deterministic tests rely on the state of the repository and show the same behavior on re-runs. Flaky tests are labeled `FLAKY` throughout the CircleCI app to help you identify them.

[#most-failed-tests]
=== Most failed tests

You can view the 100 tests with the lowest success rates in their most recent pipeline executions. The table provides the following:

* Test name
* Associated job
* Run time
* Success rate

[#slowest-tests]
=== Slowest tests

You can view the 100 tests with the longest run times in their most recent pipeline executions. The table provides the following:

* Test name
* Associated job
* Run time
* Success rate
