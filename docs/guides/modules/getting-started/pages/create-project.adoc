:page-description: "Learn how to create a project in CircleCI."
:experimental:

This guide gets you started with creating a new project in CircleCI.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* Code you want to build on CircleCI.

== Build a new project on CircleCI

The authorization method used to set up your CircleCI account determines the definition of "project" in CircleCI, as well as the permissions management processes available to you:

On the **Organization Home** page, check which option you see:

* If you see a btn:[Set up a project] button, follow steps to <<set-up-a-project>> below.
* If you see a btn:[Create Project] button, follow steps to <<create-a-project>> below.

NOTE: Using CircleCI server? Use the <<set-up-a-project>> steps below. Rather than Organization Home you will see Dashboard in the web app sidebar.

[#create-a-project]
=== Create a project

If you are using a `circleci` type organization, the steps in this section apply to you.

include::ROOT:partial$tips/check-org-type.adoc[]

Choose steps to follow below, depending on where your code is stored:

[tabs]
====
GitHub App::
+
--
Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

include::ROOT:partial$create-project/steps-up-to-pipeline.adoc[Insert steps from selecting Create project up to setting up a pipeline]

. Choose a repo to connect to your project.
+
If you do not see your repo listed, select btn:[Add] to access repositories from GitHub. Select btn:[GitHub] and then btn:[Authorize in GitHub]
+
NOTE: **First GitHub project?** If this is the first GitHub project you are creating, you will be redirected to GitHub and asked to install and authorise the CircleCI GitHub App. At this point you can choose to connect CircleCI to all your repositories, or select a subset of repositories to connect. This is a one-time action that can be done by an organization administrator or someone who has admin access to a repository in your org.
+
.Choose a repo to connect your code to your project
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/choose-a-repo-github.png[Choose a repository window with option to add another VCS]

. In this next step CircleCI will prepare a config file for you, unless your repo already contains a CircleCI config file. In a later step you will commit this config to your repo on a new branch. If you do already have a CircleCI config file in your repo it will be displayed. Once you have your config, select btn:[Next: set up your triggers].
+
.Set up your CircleCI config file
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/set-up-your-config.png[Screenshot showing options to set up your config file]

. Set up triggers for your pipeline. A single GitHub App trigger is set up by default to build your project on every commit to your repo. You can xref:orchestrate:set-up-triggers.adoc[add more triggers] at this point too.
+
.Set up triggers for your pipeline
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/set-up-your-triggers.png[Screenshot showing options to set up your triggers]

. Next you can review everything you have just set up, then select btn:[Commit config and run], or btn:[Finish setup] if you already have a config file in your repo.
+
.Review and finish setup
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/review-and-finish-setup.png[Screenshot showing options to review and commit your config]

Once your project is created you will land on your pipelines page.

GitLab Cloud::
+
--

NOTE: **Remove GitLab CI/CD config** You should remove the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from projects you integrate with CircleCI. This prevents you from having CI/CD builds happening in both systems. There is an option to _disable_ GitLab CI/CD for a project in the GitLab UI but using this is **not recommended**.

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

include::ROOT:partial$create-project/steps-up-to-pipeline.adoc[Insert steps from selecting Create project up to setting up a pipeline]

. Choose a repo to connect to your project. If you do not see your repo listed, select btn:[Add] or btn:[Connect to GitLab Cloud] to authorise access to your GitLab repositories.
+
Choose a repo to connect your code to your project
+
.Choose a repo to connect your code to your project
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/choose-a-repo-gitlab.png[Choose a repository window with option to add another VCS]
+
NOTE: **First GitLab project?** If you are creating the first GitLab project for your org, you will be redirected to GitLab to authorise the integration. This is a one-time action that can be done by an organization administrator or someone who has admin access to a repository in your org.

. In the Create New Project window, ensure you have the right repo selected in the dropdown. If you have a CircleCI config file already available in your repo, CircleCI will detect it. If not you can select an option for adding one:
+
.Set up a new GitLab project
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/create-new-gitlab-project.png[Create new project window]
+
** **Fastest:** Use a config file that already exists in your repository.
** **Faster:** Let CircleCI pick a configuration file for you, and commit this to a new branch in you repository.
** **Fast:** View and edit a starter config file in the CircleCI web app and commit that to your repository yourself.

. Select **Create Project** at the bottom of the window.

. If you chose the fastest/faster options you will now be on the pipelines page of the CircleCI web app. If you chose "fast" you have some options:

** Select btn:[Commit and Run] to commit your custom configuration file on a new branch called `circleci-project-setup`.
+
.Use a generated config file
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/generated-config-commit-and-run.png[Window showing generated config and options to commit and run or use an existing config]
** Select btn:[Use Existing Config] for the option to download the generated config and instructions to commit this or another CircleCI configuration file to your repository directly. The select btn:[Start Building].

GitLab self-managed::
+
--
CAUTION: Before creating a project that you want to integrate with code in a GitLab self-managed instance, you need to set up an integration with your GitLab self-managed instance. See the xref:permissions-authentication:users-organizations-and-integrations-guide.adoc#organization-integration[GitLab self-managed integration setup] page for more information.

NOTE: **Remove GitLab CI/CD config** You should remove the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from projects you integrate with CircleCI. This prevents you from having CI/CD builds happening in both systems. There is an option to _disable_ GitLab CI/CD for a project in the GitLab UI but using this is **not recommended**.

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

include::ROOT:partial$create-project/steps-up-to-pipeline.adoc[Insert steps from selecting Create project up to setting up a pipeline]

. Choose a repo to connect to your project. If you do not see your repo listed, select btn:[Add] to access repositories from your GitLab self-managed instance.
+

****
If you set up your GitLab self-managed instance you should see your instance URL and known_hosts. If not see the xref:permissions-authentication:users-organizations-and-integrations-guide.adoc#organization-integration[integration instructions].
****
* Generate and add a personal access token with the `api` scope.

** Use the Repository dropdown menu to tell CircleCI where your code is stored.
** Use the Branch dropdown to tell CircleCI which branch to use for your pipeline.
** Select **Save**. You will then be redirected to the Pipelines page.
** The express CircleCI configuration setup is not currently available for GitLab self-managed projects. You will need to add a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository. If the repository you selected already contains a `.circleci/config.yml`, push a commit to see your pipeline on the dashboard.
+
****
For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see the following pages:

Bitbucket Data Center::
+
--
CAUTION: Before creating a project that you want to integrate with code in a Bitbucket Data Center instance, you need to set up an integration with your Bitbucket Data Center instance. See the xref:permissions-authentication:users-organizations-and-integrations-guide.adoc#organization-integration[Bitbucket Data Center integration setup] page for more information.

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

include::ROOT:partial$create-project/steps-up-to-pipeline.adoc[Insert steps from selecting Create project up to setting up a pipeline]

. Choose a repo to connect to your project. If you do not see your repo listed, select btn:[Add]. Select btn:[Bitbucket Data Center] and then btn:[Authorize in Bitbucket Data Center]
+
.Access Bitbucket data center repos
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/authorize-bitbucket-data-center.png[Choose a repository window with option to add another VCS]

. To set up your project you will need to create a project HTTP access token with the project admin scope. Create this under Projects in Bitbucket. For more information, see the link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/http-access-tokens-939515499.html[Bitbucket docs]. Copy the token somewhere safe, you will need to enter it when creating pipelines and triggers in CircleCI.
+
****
If you set up your Bitbucket Data Center instance you should see your instance URL and known_hosts. If not see the xref:permissions-authentication:users-organizations-and-integrations-guide.adoc#organization-integration[integration instructions].
****

** Use the repository dropdown menu to tell CircleCI where your code is stored.
** Use the Branch dropdown to tell CircleCI which branch to use for your pipeline.
** Select **Save**. You will then be redirected to the Pipelines page.
** The express CircleCI configuration setup is not currently available for Bitbucket Data Center projects. You will need to add a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository. If the repository you selected already contains a `.circleci/config.yml`, push a commit to see your pipeline on the dashboard.

====

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output on the pipelines page. To make changes to your pipeline, edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository.

Through creating a project and connecting your code you have set up your pipeline and a trigger. The default trigger runs your pipeline when a change is committed to your code. You can create more triggers at menu:Project settings[Project Setup] if your project integrates with GitHub, or at menu:Project settings[Triggers] if it integrates with GitLab or Bitbucket. For more information, see the xref:orchestrate:set-up-triggers.adoc[Set up triggers] page.

[#set-up-a-project]
=== Set up a project

NOTE: If you authenticated CircleCI with either the xref:integration:github-integration.adoc[GitHub OAuth app] or xref:integration:bitbucket-integration.adoc[Bitbucket Cloud], or if you use CircleCI server, the steps in this section apply to you.

Follow these steps to  set up a new project in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Organization Home** in the sidebar. The equivalent option in CircleCI server is **Dashboard**
. Select btn:[Set up a project].
+
.Set up a project
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/set-up-a-project.png[Set up a project button]
. Find your project in the list and select btn:[Set Up Project].
+
****
**Can't see your project?** Select the CircleCI logo at the top of the window to navigate to your user homepage and select an organization.

.Access your user homepage
image::guides:ROOT:create-project/user-home-page.png[Select Organization]
****

. Choose a `config.yml` option in the modal. You can choose from the following:
** **Fastest**: Use a CircleCI `.circleci/config.yml` you have already committed to your repository. For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see the <<config-intro#,Configuration Introduction>>. You will also need to specify a branch.
** **Faster**: Commit a starter CI pipeline to a new `circleci-project-setup` branch of your repository.
** **Fast**: View, edit, and commit a template `config.yml`.

. Select **Set Up Project**.

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, choose one of the following:

* Edit the config file in your repository,
* Select the ellipsis image:guides:ROOT:icons/more.svg[more icon, role="no-border"] next your project in the Pipelines or Projects dashboard and choose **Configuration File**. This opens the CircleCI configuration editor, from where you can edit and commit your `config.yml` file.
* Access the configuration editor using the btn:[Edit Config] button from a the Pipelines page when you have a project and branch selected.
