:page-description: A quickstart guide for adding a project to CircleCI and exploring some features

This quickstart provides a guided tour through setting up a project, collaborating, and tools to iterate on and debug your build configuration. The following sections cover the following:

* Create a project, connecting some existing code to CircleCI.
* Inviting team members to collaborate on your new project.
* Use the VS Code extension to debug and extend your config.
* SSH into a build to debug your project.

If you would rather jump to a full list of CircleCI `config.yml` options, see the xref:reference:ROOT:configuration-reference.adoc[Configuration reference].

== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A code repository you want to build on CircleCI.

NOTE: This guide assumes you have xref:first-steps.adoc[signed up] and connected to GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab

== 1. Connect your code

*Create a project, connect your new code repository, and commit a CircleCI configuration file. View your project build in the CircleCI app.*

*Create a project*
In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home[CircleCI web app] select your org, then select *Create project*, then follow the instructions in the app.

If you do not see these options select the CircleCI logo in the top bar to get back to your user homepage and check you have the correct org selected.

*Set up a pipeline*
Follow the in-app instructions to set up your pipelinem including connecting your code, preparing a config file and reviewing triggers.

For a more detailed look at this process see the xref:create-project.adoc[Create a project guide].

*Commit and run*
Once you have gone through the pipeline setup process in the app you have everything you need to commit your config (unless you have a config in your repo already) and build.

Review your project details and select *Commit config and run*.
