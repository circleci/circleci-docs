:page-description: MFA overview, setup, recovery, and reset process for CircleCI accounts.
:experimental:

NOTE: MFA is currently optional. Starting December 1, 2025, MFA will be required if you log in to CircleCI with your email and password.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CircleCI is available if you sign in to your CircleCI account using email and password. If you use a social login method (such as GitHub or Bitbucket), you must use your provider's MFA.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

MFA is an additional layer of security for your CircleCI account. With MFA enabled, an additional verification step is required to access your account and make changes to authentication settings, such as email or password. This means that even if your account password is compromised, only someone with access to the additional verification factor can access the account. The additional verification step involves providing a one-time password (OTP).

[#setup-mfa]
== Set up MFA

To configure MFA on your account, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[CircleCI web app], select your profile from the upper right corner, then select **User Settings**.
. Select **Password & authentication** from the sidebar.
. On the Password & authentication page, in the **Multi-factor authentication** section, select **Add authenticator app**. MFA is marked as **Not enabled** until a factor is added.
. Input your password at the password prompt.
. At the **Add authenticator app** prompt, scan the provided QR code using an authenticator app or browser extension. Then, verify the code generated by the app by inputting it into the provided text box.
. At the next screen, you are provided with the MFA recovery code. **Copy this code and save it somewhere safe.** This code will only be displayed once and is the last resort for accessing your account if you lose access to your MFA factor.
. You can just close the window to complete the setup. When MFA is successfully configured, it is marked as **Enabled** on the Password & authentication page.

[#using-mfa]
== Using MFA on your account

Once you have MFA enabled, you must provide a second verification factor each time you log in to your account.

image::guides:ROOT:authentication/mfa-otp-login.png[Login page with request for OTP]

You will also be asked to provide a second factor whenever you attempt to change your account's authentication settings (for example, updating your email or password).

Currently, CircleCI supports MFA only via authenticator applications. The OTP will be displayed in the authenticator app, and you must enter it when prompted in the CircleCI web app.

[#mfa-recovery-codes]
== MFA recovery codes

WARNING: If you have MFA enabled and lose access to both your MFA factor and recovery code, you will lose access to your account. You must ensure that you do not lose the recovery code.

If you lose access to your MFA factor (for example, by losing the authenticator app), you can use the recovery code as a second factor. A recovery code may only be used once, after which a new recovery code is generated and shared with you in the CircleCI web app. You can always save the latest code in a safe place.

To intentionally regenerate your MFA recovery code:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[CircleCI web app], select your profile from the upper right corner, then select **User Settings**.
. Select **Password & authentication** from the sidebar.
. On the Password & authentication page, in the **Multi-factor authentication** section, select **Add/edit authenticator app**.
. Input your password at the password prompt.
. Input your OTP at the OTP prompt. Once these have been successfully submitted, your OTP ID and recovery code ID will be displayed.
. Select the button to **Regenerate recovery code** on the recovery code row.
. At the prompt to regenerate the recovery code, select `Yes, regenerate code`. This will generate a new recovery code and invalidate the previous one. Please make sure to store the new code in a safe place. It will not be displayed again.

[#mfa-reset-process]
== MFA Reset Process

The MFA reset process depends on your situation and whether you retain access to your account.

=== Scenario 1: You still have account access

If you can log in and want to reconfigure your authenticator app or regenerate your recovery code:

. Go to **User Settings** in the CircleCI web app.
. Select **Password & authentication**.
. In the **Multi-factor authentication** section, select **Add/edit authenticator app**.
. Enter your password and OTP when prompted.
. Follow the setup steps to scan the new QR code with your authenticator app.
. Click **Regenerate recovery code** to generate a new code.
. **Store the new recovery code securely** – it will only be displayed once, and the previous code becomes invalid.

=== Scenario 2: You are locked out (no authenticator app or recovery code)

If you have lost access to both your authenticator app and recovery code, you are locked out of your CircleCI account. CircleCI cannot bypass MFA for security reasons. The only way to regain access is through your recovery code. Support cannot reset MFA if you have no recovery code and cannot verify your identity.

=== Scenario 3: Support-initiated MFA reset

In some cases, if you are locked out but can verify your identity (such as by providing your login email address, account name, geographic location, IP address, or other account-specific information), CircleCI support may reset MFA on a case-by-case basis.

[#faqs]
== FAQs

=== I have lost access to the device that has my authenticator app. What should I do now?

You can use your recovery code to authenticate. Then you can add a new MFA factor and delete the one you can no longer access.

=== I have a new phone and don't want to lose my MFA factor. What should I do?

Check the documentation of your authenticator app for advice on how to transfer codes. Many authenticator apps support transferring codes to a new device.

=== Can I use the same authenticator app for multiple accounts?

Yes, most authenticator apps support multiple accounts. Check your authenticator application's documentation to confirm.

=== My authenticator codes have stopped working when I try to use them. What should I do?

Check that the time on your device is up to date. If your authenticator app does not automatically sync time, check for a setting to re-sync it. If you continue to have issues and can't use the OTP, you can use your recovery code to authenticate instead. You can then remove and re-add the MFA factor.

[#vcs-mfa]
== Enabling MFA for VCS Logins

- **GitHub:** Enable 2FA via GitHub's security settings.
- **Bitbucket:** Enable 2FA via Bitbucket's security settings.

CircleCI does not manage or enforce MFA for VCS logins – it relies entirely on the provider's authentication system.

[#support-escalation]
== Support Escalation Summary

- **User has recovery code:** Guide them through self-service reset via User Settings.
- **User locked out, no recovery code:** Escalate to support for identity verification and case-by-case assessment.
- **VCS login issues:** Direct to VCS provider support.
