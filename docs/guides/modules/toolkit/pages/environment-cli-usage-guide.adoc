:page-description: Using the CircleCI environment CLI in your CI/CD pipeline
:experimental:

This page provides reference documentation for the CircleCI environment CLI, which is the CLI available in your CircleCI pipelines.

== Introduction

This reference guide covers some basic information about the CircleCI task-agent CLI, including:

* Complete command reference - available commands and subcommands.
* Flag documentation - Comprehensive flag options with descriptions.
* Usage examples - Practical examples showing real-world usage patterns.
* Command descriptions - Clear explanations of what each command does.

== CLI differentiation

The environment CLI is different from the xref:local-cli.adoc[CircleCI local CLI] tool that you may already know. Understanding the difference between these two CLI interfaces is essential for effective usage during your build processes.

The CircleCI environment CLI:: A specialized command-line interface. The environment CLI retrieves and configures a task before managing the execution of the job within a chosen compute environment. The environment CLI is available for use in your CI/CD pipelines.

The Local CLI:: The development tool used on a local machine. It handles day-to-day development tasks, testing, and local workflow management.

These tools share some similarities. However, they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts with different capabilities and permissions.

== Root command

The CLI tool available in CircleCI pipelines. The root command is `circleci`.

== Subcommands

=== Environment variables

Use `env` to manage environment variables

==== Substitution

`subst` is a subcommand for `env`. Use `circleci env subst` to substitute environment variables in a string.

*Example usage:*

Consider this scenario: In your repository there exists a file called `template.json`, with values replaced by environment variable strings, as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "foo": "$FOO",
  "provider": "${PROVIDER}"
}
----

The config example below shows the corresponding environment variables defined directly within a step in the config.

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  process-template:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Process template file
          environment:
            FOO: bar
            PROVIDER: circleci
          command: |
            ## circleci env subst [flags]
            circleci env subst < template.json > deploy.json
            cat deploy.json
workflows:
  env-subst-workflow:
    jobs:
      - process-template
----

In this example:

* The `<` symbol redirects the contents of the `template.json` file as input to the `circleci env subst` command.
* The `>` symbol redirects the output of the `env subst` command to the `deploy.json` file.

Alternatively, you can pass input to the `circleci env subst` command as an argument: `circleci env subst "hello \$WORLD"`.

Output:

[source,json]
----
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "provider": "circleci"
}
----

For more information on using the `env` command, see the xref:security:env-vars.adoc#environment-variable-substitution[Introduction to environment variables] page.

=== Run

Invokes a task-agent subcommand by name.

==== OpenID Connect tokens

A subcommand of `run`. The `circleci run oidc` command runs authentication using OIDC.

For more information, including an example, see the xref:permissions-authentication:oidc-tokens-with-custom-claims.adoc[OpenID Connect tokens with custom claims] page.

==== Release

A subcommand of `run`. The `circleci run release` commands allow you to manage your deployments.

===== Plan

A subcommand of `release`. The `circleci run release plan` command is used to plan and identify a new deployment that will be referenced in the CircleCI UI. When a release is planned you can then update its status later in your pipeline to track progress of a deployment.

A _planned_ deployment is displayed in the Deploys UI with `pending` status.

*Flags*

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Flag | Description

| `deploy-name`
| An arbitrary positional argument that is used to identify the deployment. This should be unique within the workflow.

| `environment-name`
| Sets the target environment. If the specified environment does not exist, it will be created. If you do not specify an environment, CircleCI will create one named default.

| `component-name`
| Sets the name that will be displayed in the UI. If you do not already have a component in your project a new one will be created with the name of the project. This will be set as the component that is being deployed.

| `target-version`
| Should match the version being deployed.

| `namespace`
| Optional flag to use a namespace value other than default.
|===

*Example usage:*

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  deploy-my-service:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current
    steps:
      - run:
          command: |
            ## example usage of run release plan
            circleci run release plan <deploy-name> --environment-name=<some-environment-name> --component-name=<some-component-name> --target-version=<some-version-name> --namespace=<some-namespace>
----

For more information on using the `circleci run release plan` command, see the xref:deploy:configure-deploy-markers.adoc[Configure deploy markers] page.

===== Update

WARNING: The `circleci run release update` command is only for use with deploy markers. If you are using the CircleCI xref:deploy:release-agent-overview.adoc[release agent] for Kubernetes deployments, do NOT use the `update` commands. The release agent automatically handles status updates for you.

A subcommand of `release`. Use the `circleci run release update` command to update the status of the deployment.

*Flags*

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Flag | Description

| `status`
| Update the deploy status (values can be `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, or `FAILED`).

*Flags*

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Flag | Description

| `environment-name`
| Sets the target environment. If the specified environment does not exist, it will be created. If you do not specify an environment, CircleCI will create one named default.

| `target-version`
| Should match the version you are deploying.

| `namespace`
| Optional flag to use a namespace value other than default.
|===

*Example usage:*

----
## These commands would be equivalent:
circleci task halt
