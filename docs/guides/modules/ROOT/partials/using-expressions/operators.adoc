| Operator type | Operators | Description

| Logical
|`and`, `or`
| These are short-circuiting boolean operators.

| Equality
| `==`, `!=`
| String, numeric, and boolean equality. If the operands are of different types then `==` will evaluate `false`, and `!=` will evaluate `true`.

| Equality
| `starts-with`
| String prefix equality, `"hello world" starts-with "hello"` evaluates as `true`. It is an error to use a non-string type as an operand.

| Numeric comparison
| `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`
| Numeric comparisons. It is an error to use a non-numeric type as an operand.

| Negation
| `not`
a| Boolean negation.

Note that `not` has very high precedence and so binds very tightly. Use sub-expressions to apply `not` to more complex expressions. For example, with `foo` being `true` and `bar` being `false`:

  * `not foo and bar` evaluates to `false`
  * `not (foo and bar)` evaluates to `true`
