=== Does CircleCI use my data to train AI models?

No, CircleCI does not store your source code or use it for training purposes. Chunk processes your code temporarily to generate fixes but does not retain or share this information with model providers for training.

=== How long are Chunk's logs stored?

Chunk's logs are stored by CircleCI for 90 days. 90 days is a fixed retention period that applies to all organizations, link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/5645222646939-Cloud-Data-Retention-Policy-and-Settings[regardless of your plan’s standard data retention policy, window=_blank]. After 90 days, logs are automatically deleted to keep your workspace at optimal performance.
