[#what-types-of-orbs-are-available]
=== What types of orbs are available?

CircleCI supports three types of orbs:

* **Inline orbs**: Defined directly in your project's `.circleci/config.yml` file. They are project-specific and ideal for reusable configuration within a single project.
* **URL orbs**: Stored at an accessible URL (like GitHub or S3) and shared across your organization using an allow-list.
* **Registry orbs**: Published to the CircleCI Orb Registry with semantic versioning, available publicly or privately.

For a detailed comparison, see the xref:orbs:use:orb-concepts.adoc#orb-types-comparison[Orb Types Comparison] section.

[#which-orb-type-should-i-use]
=== Which orb type should I use?

Choose **inline orbs** when:

* Configuration is specific to one project.
* You want zero publishing overhead.
* You're learning about orbs.

Choose **URL orbs** when:

* You need to share configuration across your organization.
* You need direct control over updates.
* Configuration contains proprietary logic.

Choose **registry orbs** when:

* You want to share with the community.
* You need semantic versioning.
* You want discoverability in the Orb Registry.

See the xref:orbs:use:orb-intro.adoc#choosing-an-orb-type[Choosing an Orb Type] section for more guidance.

[#can-orbs-be-private]
=== Can registry orbs be made private?

xref:orbs:use:orb-intro.adoc#public-or-private[Private Registry Orbs] are available on any of our link:https://circleci.com/pricing[Current Plans]. Inline orbs are inherently private to the project. URL orbs are controlled by your organization's allow-list and hosting access.

[#difference-between-commands-and-jobs]
=== What is the difference between commands and jobs?

Both xref:reference:ROOT:reusing-config.adoc#the-commands-key[Commands] and xref:reference:ROOT:reusing-config.adoc#authoring-parameterized-jobs[Jobs] are elements that can be used within orbs.

_Commands_ contain one or many xref:reference:ROOT:configuration-reference.adoc#steps[Steps], which contain the logic of the orb. Commands generally execute some shell code (Bash).

_Jobs_ are a definition of what steps/commands to run and the xref:reference:ROOT:reusing-config.adoc#the-executors-key[Executor] to run them in. _Jobs_ invoke commands, and are orchestrated using xref:guides:orchestrate:workflows.adoc#workflows-configuration-examples[Workflows].

[#orbs-on-private-installation-server]
=== Can orbs be used on a private installation of CircleCI Server?

Orbs can be used with installations of CircleCI Server. For information on importing and using orbs for server, see the xref:server-admin:operator:managing-orbs.adoc[CircleCI Server Managing Orbs] page.

[#report-an-issue-with-a-public-orb]
=== How can I report a bug or issue with a public orb?

All public orbs are open source projects. Issues, bug reports, or even pull requests can be made against the orb's git repository. Public orb authors may opt to include a link to the git repo on the orb registry. If the git repo link is unavailable, contact support and we will attempt to contact the author. Alternatively, consider forking the orb and publishing your own version.

[#how-to-use-the-latest-version-of-an-orb]
=== How do I use the latest version of a registry orb?

Registry orbs use semantic versioning. If you set the _major_ version (example: `3`), you will receive all _minor_ and _patch_ updates. If you statically set the version (example: `3.0.0`), no updates will apply. Using a static version is the most deterministic and recommended method.

NOTE: Inline orbs do not have versions (updated by editing the config file), and URL orbs use Git-based versioning (branches, tags, or commits) rather than semantic versioning.

WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED - It is possible to use `@volatile` to receive the last published version of an orb. This is not recommended as breaking changes are expected.
