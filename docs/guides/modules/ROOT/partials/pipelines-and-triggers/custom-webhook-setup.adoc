Installing the GitHub App is a one-time step that can be done by an organization admin. Once installed, further GitHub App pipelines can be set up without this installation step. For a detailed guide to using both OAuth and GitHub App integrations, see the xref:integration:using-the-circleci-github-app-in-an-oauth-org.adoc[Using the CircleCI GitHub App in an OAuth organization] page. If you run into issues when installing the GitHub App, for example, App looks installed on GitHub, but does not show up on CircleCI, submit a request through link:https://forms.gle/aaVERZNNvzsDLJJ46[this form].
