Before you can install self-hosted runners through the web app, you will need to agree to the https://circleci.com/legal/runner-terms/[CircleCI Runner Terms]. To be able to gain access to the *Self-Hosted Runners* section of the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] or your CircleCI server app, an admin in your organization needs to navigate to menu:Organization Settings[Self-Hosted Runners], and agree to the terms.

Once the terms have been accepted, **Self-Hosted Runners** will appear permanently in the side navigation.

Your role within your org is determined differently depending on how you integrate with your code, as follows:

* If you have a `github` or `bitbucket` type organization, CircleCI mirrors VCS permissions for organizations. If you are an admin on your organization's VCS, you are an admin on CircleCI. If you are unsure, https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034990033-Am-I-an-Org-Admin[check the admin permissions] on your VCS.

* If you have a `circleci` type organization, you can check roles by navigating to menu:Organization Settings[People]. Full details on roles and permissions are available in the xref:guides:permissions-authentication:roles-and-permissions-overview.adoc[Roles and Permissions Overview].

TIP: Find out about organization types in the xref:guides:permissions-authentication:users-organizations-and-integrations-guide.adoc[Users, Organizations and Integrations Guide].
