:description: A how to guide for deploying changes to AWS ECS using CircleCI orbs.
:experimental:

In this how-to guide, you will learn how to configure CircleCI to deploy to AWS ECS using CircleCI orbs.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

The Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a scalable container orchestration service that enables you to support Docker containers and allows you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. By using Amazon ECS, you will be able to use this service without installing and configuring your own container orchestration software, thereby eliminating the complexity of your deployment and ensuring you have a simple and optimized container deployment on the CircleCI platform. This guide shows you how to deploy software changes to Amazon ECS using CircleCI orbs.

[#set-environment-variables]
== 1. Set environment variables

The following environment variables need to be set. For more information on how to set environment variables, refer to the xref:security:set-environment-variable.adoc[Set an environment variable] page. You can also use a xref:security:contexts.adoc[context]:

* `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_URL`
* `MY_APP_PREFIX`
* `AWS_REGION`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

NOTE: the `CIRCLE_SHA1` variable used in this example is built-in, so it is always available.

[#specify-a-version]
== 2. Specify a version

Every CircleCI `config.yml` starts with the version key. This key is used to issue warnings about breaking changes.

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
----

NOTE: `2.1` is the latest CircleCI version, and it ensures you have access to all our latest features and improvements.

[#use-orbs]
== 3. Use orbs

In this example you will need to use three orbs in your configuration. Add them at the start of your `.circleci/config.yaml`, as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
orbs:
  aws-ecr: circleci/aws-ecr@9.3.5 # use the AWS ECR orb
  aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@6.0.0 # use the AWS ECS orb
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@5.1.1 # use the AWS CLI orb
----

TIP: When using orbs, it is a good idea to check the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry] to ensure you are using the most recent version, or the version that fits best with your project.

[#create-workflow]
== 4. Create workflow

A workflow is a set of rules for defining a collection of jobs and their run order. Workflows support complex job orchestration using a set of configuration keys to help you resolve failures sooner. Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run. CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit. Learn more about xref:reference:ROOT:configuration-reference.adoc#workflows[workflow configuration].

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-and-deploy: # this can be any name you choose
----

[#build-push-and-deploy-a-service-update]]
== 5. Build, push and deploy a service update

To configure an link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/update-service.html[AWS service update] to deploy a newly built image from AWS ECR, you can use orbs to keep your configuration as simple as possible:

* The `build_and_push_image` job from the ECR orb to build and push an updated image to ECR
* The `deploy_service_update` from the ECS orb to deploy your service update

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - aws-ecr/build_and_push_image: # orb built-in job
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup:
                role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012
          repo: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}'
          tag: '${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
      - aws-ecs/deploy_service_update: # orb built-in job
          requires:
            - aws-ecr/build_and_push_image
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup:
                role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012
          family: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service'
          cluster: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster'
          container_image_name_updates: 'container=${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service,tag=${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
----

[#verify-the-deployment]
== 6. Verify the deployment

Once you have updated the Amazon ECS service, you can verify the update was correctly applied. To keep your config as simple as possible, use the AWS CLI and ECS orbs. This time, rather than using an orb's built-in job to perform the required process, commands from the orbs are used as steps in a newly-defined job named `verify-deployment`.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  verify-deployment:
    executor: aws-cli/default
    steps:
      - aws-cli/setup:
          aws_access_key_id: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
          region: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
          aws_secret_access_key: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
      - run:
          name: Get last task definition
          command: >
            TASK_DEFINITION_ARN=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition \
                --task-definition ${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service \
                --output text \
                --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn')
            echo "export TASK_DEFINITION_ARN='${TASK_DEFINITION_ARN}'" >>
            "$BASH_ENV"
      - aws-ecs/verify_revision_is_deployed:
          family: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service'
          cluster: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster'
          task_definition_arn: '${TASK_DEFINITION_ARN}'
----

This section illustrates how you can use the orb to install and configure the AWS CLI, retrieve the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html[task definition] that was previously deployed, and then _verify_ the revision has been deployed using the `verify-revision-is-deployed` command from the `AWS-ECS` orb.

[#add-verification-job-to-the-workflow]
== 7. Add verification job to the workflow

Now that we have our verification job, `verify-deployment`, we can add it to our `build-and-deploy` workflow and ensure it runs sequentially, after the build and deploy jobs using the `requires` key.

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - aws-ecr/build_and_push_image: # orb built-in job
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup:
                role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012
          repo: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}'
          tag: '${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
      - aws-ecs/deploy_service_update: # orb built-in job
          requires:
            - aws-ecr/build_and_push_image
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup:
                role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012
          family: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service'
          cluster: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster'
          container_image_name_updates: 'container=${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service,tag=${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
      - verify-deployment:
          requires:
            - aws-ecs/deploy_service_update
