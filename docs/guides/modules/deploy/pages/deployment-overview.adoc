:page-description: Learn the basics of deployment and deploys management with CircleCI.
:experimental:

With CircleCI you can deploy to any target and manage your deployments in the CircleCI web app. Track deployments using deploy markers and use rollbacks to revert to a previous version

== Introduction

Once a software application has been developed and tested, it needs to be deployed and made available for its intended audience. With CircleCI, you can deploy to virtually any target and configure CircleCI to integrate with other services for:

* QA and testing.
* Feature management.
* Deployment strategies such as canary deployment.

Customize your configuration to match your requirements, whether you need a fully automated process or one that requires manual approval.

Set up deploy markers to track deployments in the CircleCI web app and rollback to previous versions as required.

== The basics of deployment

The following list outlines the core components you need to get a deployment set up:

* **Deployment job**: To deploy your application, add a xref:orchestrate:jobs-steps.adoc#jobs-overview[job] to your `.circleci/config.yml` file and configure the job to run the steps you require.
+
TIP: Use the *how-to guides* in this section (select how-to guides from the left-hand navigation) to manage common deployment use cases.

* *Deploy markers*: Add deploy markers to log, view, and rollback your deployments. Deploy markers are configured as steps in your deployment job to **view a list of deployments** in the CircleCI web app. See the xref:configure-deploy-markers.adoc[Configure Deploy Markers] guide to learn more.

* **Deployment parameters**: You may need to add environment variables and SSH keys to fulfill your deployment steps.
Environment variables can be:
** Defined within your configuration
** Added to the project itself through the CircleCI web app:
*** Add project-level xref:security:set-environment-variable.adoc#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[environment variables]
***  Add project-level xref:integration:add-ssh-key.adoc[SSH keys].
** Added at the organization level using xref:security:contexts.adoc[contexts].

* **Manual approval**: If your deployment strategy requires a manual approval step, you can include a xref:orchestrate:workflows.adoc#holding-a-workflow-for-a-manual-approval[hold/approve] job in your workflow.
This job will create a manual approval button visible in the CircleCI web app workflows map.

* *IP-based restrictions*: If you need to restrict connections, consider enabling xref:security:ip-ranges.adoc[IP ranges] for your deployment job.

=== Using orbs to simplify deployment

Look in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[orbs registry] to find an orb for your deployment target. Orbs can help you simplify your configuration by using pre-configured jobs and commands.

xref:orbs:use:orb-intro.adoc[Orbs] are packages of reusable configuration.
For simpler deployment pipelines, you can use orbs to achieve the results you need with minimal configuration.

Orbs are available for many common deployment targets.

For example, the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-code-deploy[AWS CodeDeploy orb] has a pre-configured `deploy` job that you can include in your configuration with the single line: `aws-code-deploy/deploy`. Orb jobs can be used once the orb has been invoked by adding the orbs stanza:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-code-deploy: circleci/aws-code-deploy@x.y
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@x.z
workflows:
  deploy_application:
    jobs:
      - aws-code-deploy/deploy:
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup
          application-name: myApplication
          bundle-bucket: myApplicationS3Bucket
          bundle-key: myS3BucketKey
          deployment-group: myDeploymentGroup
          service-role-arn: myDeploymentGroupRoleARN
```

Under the hood, this orb creates, bundles, and deploys your application using your specified parameters set under the `aws-code-deploy/deploy` job declaration.

Check out the full range of available orbs in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[orbs registry]. If the orb you need has not been created yet, consider xref:orbs:author:orb-author.adoc[authoring one]!

=== Using images to simplify deployment

CircleCI provides maintained Docker images (convenience images) that contain the tools required for common deployment scenarios.
Convenience images provide fast spin-up times, reliability, and stability.
Visit the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=docker[CircleCI Developer Hub] to learn more about each convenience image:

== Deployment tracking and management

Deploy markers provide a lightweight way to log your deployments. Deploy markers generate a log of all deployments in one place, for a clear overview of what has changed, without the need to search through your CI/CD pipelines. Deploy markers log all new deployments in one place and link back to the CI/CD pipelines that caused them.

See the xref:configure-deploy-markers.adoc[Configure Deploy Markers] page for full setup details.

To use deploy markers, you will add commands to your pipeline configuration to enable CircleCI to log and track deployment status in the CircleCI UI. Once deploy markers are set up, you can rollback to a previous version of a component from the CircleCI web app.

If you are deploying to Kubernetes you can also use the CircleCI xref:release-agent-overview.adoc[Release Agent Overview], which you install in your cluster to enable you to manage your deployments through CircleCI.

== Deploy markers quickstart

To get started with deploy markers right away, refer to the following guides:

* xref:configure-deploy-markers.adoc[Tutorial 1: Configure CircleCI deploy markers]
* xref:set-up-rollbacks.adoc[Tutorial 2: Set up rollbacks]

== Concepts

The sections below explain some key software delivery concepts. Understanding these concepts will help you take full advantage of CircleCI deploy markers and the release agent.

=== Command

A _command_ is a user-initiated action CircleCI performs on the user's behalf to manipulate a specific component. Actions are run asynchronously via our release agent and the results are reported back to the CircleCI web app. You can see the results in the deployments dashboard, similarly to how step output works for CI jobs.

Some commands are available for all components. These are:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

A subset of commands are available for _progressive_ deployments (when using Argo Rollouts). These are:

* Retry deployment
* Promote deployment
* Cancel deployment

=== Component

A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit. In Kubernetes terms, this would be a Deployment or Rollout object along with the related objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, etc. that share a common `circleci.com/component-name` label.

=== Delivery

_Delivery_ is the act of packaging code changes and making them available for Deployment. Continuous delivery is the prerequisite step for continuous deployment. With some variations on the technologies being used, the delivery process creates executables from code and then makes them available to be deployed to an environment at a subsequent time.

=== Deployment

_Deployment_ is the act of putting a new component version into an environment, regardless of whether users and other services interact with the new version or a previous one. Depending on the deployment type, a release may happen either:

* As a later task, such as switching over traffic shaping rules for a blue/green deployment.
* As a direct consequence of the deployment, such as a standard Kubernetes rolling update.

=== Release

A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services.

A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

In the deploys dashboard, deployments are tagged as **Progressive** if they refer to an Argo Rollout.

A deployment starts when the component version is updated, and ends when the new version has reached 100% availability, and all associated validations have been completed. In the case of a progressive deployment, this happens when the Rollout completes. In the case of a Kubernetes Deployment, this happens when the Deployment replicas are all available and ready.

[#the-deploys-UI]
== The deploys UI

The CircleCI deploys UI is a powerful tool for visualising, monitoring and managing your deployments. The pages included in the deploys UI are described below.

[#dashboard]
=== The dashboard

image::guides:ROOT:releases/dashboard.png[Screenshot showing the deploys dashboard in the CircleCI web app]

Select **Deploys** in the CircleCI web app sidebar to enter the deploys dashboard. The dashboard shows the following:

* **Timeline**: A timeline of deploys across your organization's components and environments. You can use the filter dropdown menus at the top of the page to select a component and/or environment. You will see live status updates, deployment trigger source, deployment version version, deployment type (for example, _progressive_, when you are using an Argo Rollout). From here you can access the following:
** The deployment details page for a specific deployment by clicking on the status badge or version number.
** The component or environment details pages by clicking on the respective names.
** The project dashboard for the CircleCI project associated with a deployment.
** The job details page for the job that started the deployment.
** The commit details page in your VCS for the commit that started the deployment.

* **Environments**: List of environment integrations set up for your organization. From here you can:
** Set up a new environment integration by selecting btn:[Create Environment Integration].
** Access settings for each environment image:guides:ROOT:icons/settings.svg[settings icon, role="no-border"].
** Access the environment details view by selecting an environment name.

* **Components**: A list of components and their associated projects. From here you can:
** Set up a new component by selecting btn:[Create Component]. From here you can select and environment that has a successful environment integration set up, and from there you can add a new component.
** Get straight to the component's project building on CircleCI by selecting the project name.
** Access setting for each component image:guides:ROOT:icons/settings.svg[settings icon, role="no-border"].

=== Filter and group components and environments with labels

Add labels to your components and environments to provide teams with a way to filter and group content in the deploys UI. Once a label is added, you can use this to filter your view to focus on the content relevant to your team.

Labels are composed of two values separated by a colon, for example, `team:my-team-name`. To specify multiple labels for a component or environment, you can separate them with a comma. For example, `team:my-team-name, role:web`. You can add up to 20 labels to a component or environment.

==== Use labels to filter components and environments

Once you have added labels to your components and environments, you can use them to filter your view in the deploys UI. In the timeline, environments, or components view, select a filter to reduce the content in the tab to only your selection. You can also use the label filter dropdown menu at the top of the page.

To add or edit labels follow the steps below.
