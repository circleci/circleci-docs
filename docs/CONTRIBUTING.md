Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CircleCI documentation.

**If you're considering contributing a completely new article, we encourage you to contribute to the 2.0 documentation found at <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/> or in this repo in `/jekyll/_cci2/`.**

# CircleCI Documentation Values

There is never enough time to do everything we want to do.
That's why we prioritize issues according to the following four categories, in decreasing importance:

1. Correct: documentation should be accurate.
2. Current: documentation should be up-to-date.
3. Consistent: documentation should not conflict with itself.
4. Clear: documentation should be clear.

These values apply to both new and existing documentation.

# Contributing to CircleCI Docs

We welcome all contributions to CircleCI documentation.
These contributions come in two forms: issues and pull requests.

## Issues

If you spot anything
that conflicts with our values,
opening a GitHub Issue is a great way
to give us specific feedback.

To make an issue,
refer to the [GitHub Issues Workflow](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/wiki/GitHub-Issues-Workflow) wiki page.

## Pull Requests

If you feel motivated,
you can make documentation changes
and submit a pull request.

For minor changes like typos,
click "Suggest an edit to this page",
located at the bottom of each document.
This will take you to the source file on GitHub,
where you can submit a pull request for your changes.

For larger edits or new documents,
[set up a local environment](local-development.md).
When you are satisfied with your changes,
create a pull request from your branch
by following [GitHub's guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Regardless of the size of your change,
do read through our [Style Guide](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/wiki/Style-Guide).

### Titles and Descriptions

Pull request titles should be descriptive enough
for reviewers to understand *what* is being changed.
Some ways of doing this are better than others:

| Original Pull Request Title | Better Title                                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Updating file.md_          | _Indicate support for environment variables in context paths_            |
| _Sidebar changes_           | _Move Deployment to its own navigation section for better organization_  |

Every pull request should have a description
that explains *why* the change is being made.
The description adds context
that is critical for reviewers when giving feedback.
