CircleCI is completely configurable.
We have a simple setup for projects that follow established conventions, but we also support many variations on the theme.

*   You can [ run tests from a subdirectory of your repository](/docs/configuration#subdirectory).
*   You can [override every single phase of your tests](/docs/configuration)
    with custom settings or minor tweaks.
*   Though you'll rarely need it, you can tweak your code to
    [avoid certain behaviours](/docs/dont-run) during your CI builds.
