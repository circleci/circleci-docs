:experimental:
:page-aliases: orb-development-kit

CircleCI orbs are packages of xref:use:orb-concepts.adoc#orb-configuration-elements[Reusable Configuration] that you can import into your CircleCI configuration files. Orbs come in three types:

*Inline orbs*:: Defined directly within a project's configuration file. Inline orbs are project-specific and ideal for learning, testing, or when reusable configuration does not need to be shared beyond a single project.

*URL orbs*:: Stored anywhere accessible by your CircleCI project. URL orbs are referenced by a URL to import into your configuration files. Access is managed at the organization level using an allow list.

*Registry orbs*:: Packaged and, if public, published to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[orb registry]. Registry orbs can be imported into configuration files either within an organization if private or by anyone if public.

If you manage multiple, similar projects, consider abstracting out your config with orbs.

== Prerequisites

Before authoring an orb, we recommend that you become familiar with the xref:guides:getting-started:config-intro.adoc[Configuration Reference] and authoring xref:reference:ROOT:reusing-config.adoc[Reusable Configuration Reference] pages.

Orbs consist of three main elements. You can follow the links for each to learn more:

* xref:use:orb-concepts.adoc#commands[Commands]
* xref:use:orb-concepts.adoc#jobs[Jobs]
* xref:use:orb-concepts.adoc#executors[Executors]

== Getting started with inline orbs

Inline orbs are the simplest way to create reusable configuration within a single project. They require no setup, publishing, or external hosting.

To create an inline orb, define it directly in your `.circleci/config.yml` file using the `orbs` stanza. For a complete guide and examples, see the xref:create-an-inline-orb.adoc[Create an Inline Orb] guide.

Inline orbs are particularly useful for:

* Learning orb concepts and syntax.
* Testing reusable configuration before converting to a URL orb or registry orb.
* Project-specific helper commands and jobs that don't need to be shared.

== Getting started with URL orbs

URL orbs are reusable CircleCI configuration stored in an accessible location like a Git repository.

See the xref:create-test-and-use-url-orbs.adoc[Create, Test, and Use URL Orbs] guide for steps to create and use a URL orb.

URL orbs are particularly useful for:

* Sharing configuration across your organization.
* Using proprietary or confidential configurations.
* Direct control over updates and distribution.
* Bypassing the orb publishing process and semantic versioning.

== Getting started with registry orbs

[CAUTION]
====
Registry orb authors *automatically agree* to the CircleCI link:https://circleci.com/legal/code-sharing-terms/[Code Sharing Terms of Service]. All publicly published orbs are made available on the Orb Registry under the link:https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT License agreement]. For more information, see link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/licensing[Orb Licensing].

*Once a registry orb is created it cannot be deleted*. Registry orbs are link:https://semver.org/[SemVer compliant], and each published version is immutable. Publicly released orbs are potential dependencies for other projects. Therefore, allowing orb deletion would make users susceptible to unexpected loss of functionality.
====

We recommend using our <<orb-development-kit>> to create a registry orb. A full guide is available in the xref:create-test-and-publish-a-registry-orb.adoc[Create, Test, and Publish a Registry Orb] guide.

Alternatively, as orbs are packages of xref:reference:ROOT:reusing-config.adoc[Reusable Configuration], they can be written manually too, as singular `yaml` files, and published using our xref:guides:toolkit:local-cli.adoc#installation[CircleCI Orb CLI]. For a guide, see the  xref:manual-orb-authoring-process.adoc[Manual Orb Authoring Process] page.

== Orb development tools (registry orbs only)

NOTE: The tools in this section apply to *registry orbs only*.

[#orb-development-kit]
=== Orb development kit

The orb development kit refers to a suite of tools that work together to simplify the registry orb development process, with automatic testing and deployment on CircleCI. The `orb init` command is the key to using the orb development kit. This command initiates a new orb project based on a template, and that template uses the other tools in the kit to automatically test and deploy your orb.

The orb development kit is made up of the following components:

* link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template[Orb Template].
* link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/[CircleCI CLI].
** link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_pack.html[Orb Pack Command].
** link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_init.html[Orb Init Command].
* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/orb-tools[Orb Tools Orb].

The *orb template* is a repository with CircleCI's orb project template, which is automatically ingested and modified by the `orb init` command.

The *CircleCI CLI* contains two commands which are designed to work with the kit. The *orb init command* initializes a new orb project, and the *orb pack command* packs the orb source into a single `orb.yml` file.

The *orb tools orb* is an orb for creating orbs.

[#orb-cli]
=== Orb CLI

To begin creating orbs, follow the CircleCI CLI xref:guides:toolkit:local-cli.adoc#installation[Installation] guide on your local machine, with a link:https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens[personal access token]. For a full list of orb-related commands inside the CircleCI CLI, visit link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb.html[CircleCI CLI help].

[#permissions-matrix]
=== Permissions matrix

Orb CLI commands are scoped to different user permission levels, set by your VCS. You are the owner of your own organization. If you are authoring or publishing registry orbs for a namespace owned by another organization, you may require assistance from your organization admin:

[.table-scroll]
--
[cols=2*, options="header"]
|===
| Orb Command | Permission Scope

| `circleci namespace create`
| Owner

| `circleci orb init`
| Owner

| `circleci orb create`
| Owner

| `circleci orb publish` development version
| Member

| `circleci orb publish` production version
| Owner
|===

== Listing and categorizing registry orbs

[#listing-your-orbs]
=== Listing your orbs

List your available orbs using the CLI:

To list xref:use:orb-intro.adoc#public-or-private[Public] orbs:

[,shell]
----
circleci orb list <my-namespace>
----

To list xref:use:orb-intro.adoc#public-or-private[Private] orbs:

[,shell]
----
circleci orb list <my-namespace> --private
----

For more information on how to use the `circleci orb` command, see the CLI link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb.html[documentation].

[#categorizing-your-orb]
=== Categorizing your orb

NOTE: Orb categorization is *not* available on installations of CircleCI Server.

You can categorize your orb for better discoverability in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry]. Categorized orbs are searchable by category in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry]. CircleCI may, from time to time, create or edit orb categorizations to improve orb discoverability.

[#listing-categories]
==== Listing categories

image::guides:ROOT:orb-categories-list-categories.png[Example of showing listing categories using the CLI]

You can select up to two categories for your orb. These are the available categories:

* Artifacts/Registry
* Build
* Cloud Platform
* Code Analysis
* Collaboration
* Containers
* Deployment
* Infra Automation
* Kubernetes
* Language/Framework
* Monitoring
* Notifications
* Reporting
* Security
* Testing

The list of categories can also be obtained by running the `circleci orb list-categories` CLI command. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_list-categories.html[here].

[#add-an-orb-to-a-category]
==== Add an orb to a category

image::guides:ROOT:orb-categories-add-to-category.png[Adding an orb category]

Add your orb to your chosen category by running `circleci orb add-to-category <namespace>/<orb> "<category-name>"`. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_add-to-category.html[here].

[#remove-an-orb-from-a-category]
==== Remove an orb from a category

image::guides:ROOT:orb-categories-remove-from-category.png[Removing an orb from a category]

Remove an orb from a category by running `circleci orb remove-from-category <namespace>/<orb> "<category-name>"`. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_remove-from-category.html[here].

[#viewing-an-orbs-categorizations]
==== Viewing an orb's categorizations

image::guides:ROOT:orb-categories-orb-info.png[Show which categorizations have been added to an orb]

To see which categorizations have been applied an orb, check the output of `circleci orb info <namespace>/<orb>` for a list. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_info.html[here].
