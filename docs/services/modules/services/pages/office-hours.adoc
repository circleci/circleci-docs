:page-description: Office Hours Service

Office hours are dedicated slots of 30 minute conversations, during which your team can bring questions or issues of a technical nature to discuss with your field engineer. Office hours do not usually follow a fixed agenda, but rather facilitate open form discussion. Your field engineering will also use this time to keep your team up to date with new features and functionality applicable to your use case.

== Benefits

Teams who engage in office hours will typically benefit from:

* Faster decision making as to how to best implement CircleCI within a broader architecture by using the experience of your field engineer as a sounding board throughout the team's own design & implementation sprints.
* Faster time-to-implementation by having the predictability of face time with your field engineer on a recurring basis, allowing for better prioritization of internal design, implementation and troubleshooting rather than waiting for asynchronous ticket responses.
* Increased self-service, independence & efficiency of engineering talent who are less likely to rely on internal engineering enablement for CircleCI related matters.

== Targeted Audience

Due to the flexible nature of office hours, there are few constraints on who such a session is most suited for. Typically though, we’d expect the attendees to work with CircleCI in a technical capacity or work indirectly with CircleCI's data or other integrations.
