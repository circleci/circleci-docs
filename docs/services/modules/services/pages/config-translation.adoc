:page-description: Configuration Translation Service

The configuration translation service is an engagement through which your field engineer translates a project's configuration from another CI tool into CircleCI configuration. A single project’s configuration will be translated per service. 

== Benefits

Teams who take advantage of a configuration translation service save time by:

* Having your field engineer write your CircleCI configuration.
* Having example configuration for other migrating projects that has been written by CircleCI experts.
* Can lean on their field engineer to research how to implement CircleCI for their use case.
* Adding your field engineer to your migration team who can consult on the CircleCI aspects of the migration process.

== Intended Audience

This service is intended to help new teams start using CircleCI with best practices in place.

Direct contributors to the migration effort of the project being translated should be involved.
