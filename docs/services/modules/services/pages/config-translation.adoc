= Configuration translation service
:page-description: Configuration translation service

The configuration translation service is an engagement where your field engineer translates a project's configuration from another CI tool into CircleCI configuration. Each service translates one project configuration. 

== Benefits

Teams who take advantage of a configuration translation service save time by:

* Having their field engineer write their CircleCI configuration.
* Getting example configurations for migrating projects written by CircleCI experts.
* Working with their field engineer to research how to use CircleCI for their use case.
* Adding their field engineer to the migration team for advice on CircleCI aspects of the migration.

== Intended audience

This training is for teams bringing a new project onto CircleCI.

Direct contributors to the migration effort for the translated project should be involved.
