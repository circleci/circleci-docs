:page-description: Configuration review service

The configuration review service evaluates a single CircleCI project and delivers a findings report. Your field engineer meets with the team that manages the project to learn about the use case and goals. After a two-week analysis, depending on the size of the project, your field engineer delivers findings. If additional help is needed to implement requirements, additional consultative time is scheduled.

Findings typically include:

* Optimization recommendations tied to your goals, such as cost savings or performance.
* Feature options for your use case.
* Right-fitting execution environments.
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) recommendations.
* Solutions specific to your project's use case.
* How your field engineer uses CircleCI data to analyze the project.

== Benefits

Teams who engage in a configuration review benefit from:

* A more optimized CI/CD pipeline that improves spend and engineering efficiency for the reviewed project.
* Best practices tailored to the project's use case.
* More self-service to apply improvements across current and future projects.
* Proactive identification of knowledge gaps, training needs, or service requirements.
* Faster user onboarding in the reviewed project.
* A clearer understanding of CircleCI data and how to use it.

== Intended audience

Configuration reviews are most useful for projects that:

* Started using CircleCI in the last six months.
* Have made a recent major change to their configuration.
* Have a heavy throughput.
* Contain complex pipelines.
* Are used as a template for other projects.
* Are showing negative metric trends.

Anyone responsible for writing or maintaining the CircleCI configuration for the reviewed project should be involved.

Developers who work on the project can gain a clearer understanding of what CircleCI does under the hood.
