* Implementing config policies to satisfy security requirements.
* Configuring self-hosted runners for specific use case.
* Setting up an integration to injest CircleCI's data.
* Many other challenges.

== Benefits

A team engaging with us in a technical consultation benefits from:

* A platform to articulate your goals or challenges so your field engineer can understand your requirements in depth.
* Tested insights, recommendations, and potential solutions from your field engineer.
* A clear, customized action plan to solve important challenges, saving time and resources.

== Intended audience

This training is for teams with a CircleCI challenge. Your field engineer consults on the CircleCI aspects of that challenge.
