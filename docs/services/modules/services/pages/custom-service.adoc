The custom service is an engagement where your field engineer works with your team to build a service that supports your DevOps goals. Examples include a adding new tool, adding a security practice, or a CircleCI feature migration.

== Benefits

Teams that work with their field engineer to create a custom service:

* Meet their DevOps goals faster with expert advice.
* Work with their field engineer to research how to use CircleCI for their use case.
* Are more agile when responding to changing priorities.
* Help the CircleCI community by identifying areas where your field engineer can assist other teams.

== Intended audience

Teams with a DevOps goal that has requirements outside the bounds of other field engineering services.
