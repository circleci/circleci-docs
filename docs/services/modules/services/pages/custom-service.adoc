* Meet their DevOps goals faster with expert advice.
* Can lean on their field engineer to research how to implement CircleCI to achieve their goals.
* Are more agile when responding to timely situations.
* Help the greater CircleCI community by identifying areas where your field engineer may be able to help other teams.

== Intended Audience

Teams with a DevOps goal that has requirements outside the bounds of other field engineering services.
