This is the public repository for [CircleCI Docs](https://circleci.com/docs/), a
static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you find any
errors in our docs or have suggestions, please follow our [Contributing
Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit an issue or pull request.

## Documentation Components

This repository houses and manages several arms of documentation for CircleCI.
This section will provide a brief overview of each "component" and how to get
started with making changes.

### `/Jekyll` - Main Site

This is the main [CircleCI documentation site](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/).
This is built with Jekyll and houses the majority of our documentation. Other
branches of documentation (`src-api`, `src-crg`, etc) eventually get moved into
this folder (in our build process) and integrated into the Jekyll Site.

We also have an automated code review tool setup, so it will run [markdownlint
](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) on your PR and review for any
markdown style violations. The rules are located at [.markdownlint.jsonc
](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/.markdownlint.jsonc).
You can also fix most of the violations automatically.

### `/src-api` - API v1.1 and v2 Build Tooling

Our API documentation source can be found in this folder.

**API v1** is written by hand, and compiled to work with
[Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). The compilation and deployment of
`v1` is handled by our `.circleci/config.yml`, which calls our `build_api_docs`
script. If you need to make changes to our V1 documentation, go to
`src-api/source/includes` and make changes as needed in the markdown files.

**API v2** is compiled from an [OpenAPI
spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). We use
[Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to compile our spec into a webpage. To
see the compilation process, refer to `build_api_docs.sh` and our
`.circleci/config.yml`. If you need to make changes to the output site, you will
likely need to make source code changes to the API, where the docs are generated
from.
