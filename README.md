This is the public repository for [CircleCI Docs](https://circleci.com/docs/), a static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you find any errors in our docs or have suggestions, please follow our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit an issue or pull request.

For minor changes like typos, you can click **Suggest an edit to this page**, located at the bottom of each article. This will take you to the source file on GitHub, where you can submit a pull request for your change through the UI.

For larger edits or new articles, you'll want to set up a local environment for editing. Please see our [Local Development README](README-local-development.md) to set that up.

If you have a question or need help debugging, please head to [CircleCI Discuss](https://discuss.circleci.com/) where our support team will help you out.

Docs for CircleCI Server Administration are built in a slightly different way so there is a [separate README](README-server-docs.md) for this section.
