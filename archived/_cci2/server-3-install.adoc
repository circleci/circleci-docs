// This doc uses ifdef and ifndef directives to display or hide content specific to Google Cloud Storage (env-gcp) and AWS (env-aws). Currently, this affects only the generated PDFs. To ensure compatability with the Jekyll version, the directives test for logical opposites. For example, if the attribute is NOT env-aws, display this content. For more information, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/.

Before you begin with the CircleCI server v3.x core services installation phase, ensure all xref:server-3-install-prerequisites.adoc[prerequisites] are met.

== Phase 2: Core services installation
CircleCI server v3.x uses https://kots.io[KOTS] from https://www.replicated.com/[Replicated] for installation management and distribution.

. Ensure you are running the minimum KOTS version ({kotsversion}) by running the command:
+
```bash
kubectl kots version
```
+
NOTE: The KOTS command opens up a tunnel to the admin console. If running on Windows inside WSL2, the port is not available on the host machine. Turning WSL off and back on should resolve the issue. For more information, please see
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4199.

. From the terminal, run (if you are installing behind a proxy see https://circleci.com/docs/server-3-install/#installing-behind-an-http-proxy[Installing behind HTTP Proxy]):
+
```bash
kubectl kots install circleci-server
```
+
You will be prompted for:
+
* namespace for the deployment
* password for the KOTS Admin Console

. When complete, you should be provided with a URL to access the KOTS admin console, usually `\http://localhost:8800`.

TIP: If you need to get back to the KOTS admin console at a later date, run: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>`

TIP: Once you have created your namespace, we recommend setting your `kubectl` context too with the following command: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace <namespace>`

=== Installing behind an HTTP Proxy (optional)

If you wish to install CircleCI server behind a proxy, use the following command structure should be used for step 2 above (for more information see the KOTS docs https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#proxies[here]):

```bash
kubectl kots install circleci-server --http-proxy <YOUR_HTTP_PROXY_URI> --https-proxy <https-proxy> --no-proxy <YOUR_NO_PROXY_LIST>
```

The load balancer endpoints must be added to the no-proxy list for the following services: `output processor` and `vm-service`. This is because the no-proxy list is shared between the application and build-agent. The application and build-agent are assumed to be behind the same firewall and therefore cannot have a proxy between them.

For further information see the https://circleci.com/docs/server-3-operator-proxy[Configuring a Proxy] guide.

=== Frontend Settings
Frontend settings control the web-application-specific aspects of the CircleCI system.

.Frontend Settings
image::server-3-frontend-settings.png[Screenshot showing frontend settings]

Complete the fields described below.

* *CircleCI Domain Name (required)* - Enter the domain name you specified when creating your Frontend TLS key and certificate.

* *Frontend Replicas* - Used to increase the amount of traffic that can be handled by the frontend.

* *Frontend TLS Private Key (required)* - You created this during your prerequisite steps. You can retrieve this value with the following command:
+
```bash
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem
```

* *Frontend TLS Certificate (required)* - You created this during your prerequisite steps. You can retrieve this value with the following command:
+
```bash
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem
```
* *Private Load Balancer (optional)* - Load balancer does not generate external IP addresses.
+
NOTE: If you are selecting the option to use private load balancers, the Let's Encrypt option will no longer work and become unavailable.

For the **Frontend TLS private key and certificate** you have 4 options:

* You can supply a private key and certificate
* Check the box that allows https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] to automatically request and manage certificates for you.
* Check the box that allows https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html[AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)] to automatically request and manage certificates for you. For more information about using ACM see the <<using-acm-tls-certificates>> section below.
* You can also disable TLS termination at this point, but the system will still need to be accessed over HTTPS.


[#using-acm-tls-certificates]
==== Using ACM TLS certificates

If you would like to use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html[AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)] to manage your TLS certificates, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html[ACM documentation] for instructions on how to generate ACM certificates.

Once you have generated your certificates, enable ACM from the KOTS admin console under the Frontend section. Check the ACM box and provide your ACM ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

[WARNING]
====
If you have already deployed CircleCI server, enabling ACM is a destructive change to your frontend service. The service will have to be regenerated to allow the use of your ACM certificates and so the associated loadbalancer will also be regenerated.
You will need to reroute your DNS records to the new loadbalancer once you have redeployed CircleCI server.
====

=== Encryption

Encryption and artifact signing keys were created during prerequisites phase. You can enter them here now.

.Encryption Settings

****
Skip over the next few sections - **Output Processor**, **Nomad** and **VM Service**. We will set these up in the next phase of the installation.
****

=== Postgres, MongoDB, Vault settings

You can skip these sections unless you plan on using an existing Postgres, MongoDB or Vault instance, in which case, see the https://circleci.com/docs/server-3-operator-externalizing-services/[Externalizing Services doc]. By default, CircleCI server v3.x will create its own Postgres, MongoDB and Vault instances within the CircleCI namespace. The instances inside the CircleCI namespace will be included in the CircleCI backup and restore process.

=== Save and deploy
Once you have completed the fields detailed above, you can deploy. The deployment installs the core services and provides you with an IP address for the Kong load balancer. That IP address is critical in setting up a DNS record and completing the first phase of the installation.

NOTE: From server v3.3.0, we have replaced https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart[Traefik] with https://github.com/Kong/charts[Kong] as our reverse proxy. However, to minimize disruption when upgrading, we chose not to rename the service used by Kong. Although you will see a service named `circleci-server-traefik`, this service is actually for Kong.

=== Create DNS entry
Create a DNS entry for your Kong load balancer, for example, `circleci.your.domain.com` and `app.circleci.your.domain.com`. The DNS entry should align with the DNS names used when creating your TLS certificate and GitHub OAuth app during the prerequisites steps. All traffic will be routed through this DNS record.

You need the IP address or, if using AWS, the DNS name of the Kong load balancer. You can find this information with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl get service circleci-server-traefik --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

For more information on adding a new DNS record, see the following documentation:

* link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/records#adding_a_record[Managing Records] (GCP)

* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html[Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 Console] (AWS)

NOTE: The Kong load balancer has a healthcheck that serves a JSON payload at https://loadbalancer-address/status

=== Validation

You should now be able to navigate to your CircleCI server installation and log in to the application successfully.

Now we will move on to build services. It may take a while for all your services to be up. You can periodically check by running the following command (you are looking for the “frontend” pod to show a status of _running_ and **ready** should show 1/1):

----
kubectl get pods -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----
