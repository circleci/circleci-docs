Upgrading your private CircleCI server installation to 2.0 gives you the ability to use Workflows, Docker as a first-class executor, and all of the additional features and stability built into CircleCI. Work with a CircleCI solutions engineer to set up a 2.0 installation in your datacenter or private cloud (requires Premium Support). Get started by [opening a support ticket](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
