Authentication of CircleCI projects using the hosted application is handled by
GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google OAuth. Sessions last for 14 days. See the
[Permissions Overview]({{ site.baseurl}}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#permissions-overview) 
section of the GitHub and Bitbucket Integration document for additional details.

User authentication may use LDAP for an instance of the CircleCI application
that is installed on your private server or cloud, see the
[Authentication]({{site.baseurl }}/2.0/authentication/) document for setup
instructions.
