The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your self-hosted runners are:

* `image:`
* `resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>`

Simple example of how you could set up a job (`cimg/base:2021.11` is a commonly used CirlceCI Docker image):

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.11
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build
```

[.tab.runner-config.Machine_runner]
--
The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your self-hosted runners are:

* `machine: true`
* `resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>`

Simple example of how you could set up a job:

```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - runner
jobs:
  runner:
    machine: true
    resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"
```
--

The job will then execute using your self-hosted runner when you push the config to your VCS provider.
