To view the compute resource usage for the duration of a job in the CircleCI web app:

1. Select **Dashboard** from the sidebar menu
1. Use the dropdown menus to select a project, and a branch
1. Expand your workflow ( <i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> )
1. Select a job by clicking on the job name
1. Select the **Resources** tab to view CPU and RAM usage for the duration of the job

You can use these insights to decide whether to make changes to the job's configured resource class. You can also access [resource class Insights](/docs/resource-class-overview/#resource-class-insights).
