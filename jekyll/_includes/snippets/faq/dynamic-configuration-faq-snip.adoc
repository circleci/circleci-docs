[#pipeline-parameters-api]
=== I thought pipeline parameters could only be used with the API?

Previously, this was true. With the dynamic configuration feature, you can now set pipeline parameters dynamically, before the pipeline is executed (triggered from either the API or a webhookâ€”a push event to your VCS).

[#can-i-use-a-custom-executor]
=== Can I use a custom executor?

Custom executors can be used, but require certain dependencies to be installed for the continuation step to work (currently: `curl`, `jq`).

[#what-is-the-continuation-orb]
=== What is the continuation orb?

The `continuation` orb assists you in managing the pipeline continuation process. The
`continuation` orb wraps an API call to link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/continuePipeline[`continuePipeline`]. Refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation[`continuation`] orb documentation for more information.

[#possible-to-not-use-continuation-orb]
=== Is it possible to not use the continuation orb?

If you have special requirements not covered by the continuation orb, you can implement the same functionality in other ways. Refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation#orb-source[orb source code] to learn how the continuation functionality is implemented with the orb.
