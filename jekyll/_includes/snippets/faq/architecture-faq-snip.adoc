=== Which CPU architectures does CircleCI support?

CircleCI supports `amd64` for Docker jobs, and both `amd64` and xref:using-arm#[Arm resources] for machine jobs.

[#ipv6-in-tests]
=== Can I use IPv6 in my tests?

You can use the xref:configuration-reference#machine[Machine executor] for testing local IPv6 traffic. Unfortunately, we do not support IPv6 internet traffic, as not all of our cloud providers offer IPv6 support.

Hosts running with machine executor are configured with IPv6 addresses for `eth0` and `lo` network interfaces.

You can also configure Docker to assign IPv6 address to containers, to test services with IPv6 setup.  You can enable it globally by configuring docker daemon like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  ipv6_tests:
    machine:
      # The image uses the current tag, which always points to the most recent
      # supported release. If stability and determinism are crucial for your CI
      # pipeline, use a release date tag with your image, e.g. ubuntu-2004:202201-02
      image: ubuntu-2004:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: enable ipv6
          command: |
            cat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
            {
              "ipv6": true,
              "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:1::/64"
            }
            EOF
            sudo service docker restart

Docker allows enabling IPv6 at different levels: link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/[globally via daemon config like above], with link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/[`docker network create` command], and with link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#enable_ipv6[`docker-compose`].
