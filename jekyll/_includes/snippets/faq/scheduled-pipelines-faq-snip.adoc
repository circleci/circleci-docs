[#can-i-migrate-existing-scheduled-workflows]
=== Can I migrate existing scheduled workflows to scheduled pipelines?

Yes, visit the xref:migrate-scheduled-workflows-to-scheduled-pipelines#[Scheduled pipelines migration] guide for more information.

[#find-schedules-that-i-have-created]
=== How do I find the schedules that I have created?

As scheduled pipelines are stored directly in CircleCI, there is a UUID associated with each schedule. You can view schedules that you have created on the **Triggers** page of the project settings. You can also list all the schedules under a single project:

```shell
curl --location --request GET "https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<project-slug>/schedule" \
--header "circle-token: <PERSONAL_API_KEY>"
```

Refer to the xref:api-developers-guide#getting-started-with-the-api[Getting started with the API] section of the API Developer's Guide for more guidance on making requests.

[#what-time-zone-is-used-for-scheduled-pipelines]
=== What time zone is used for scheduled pipelines?

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the time zone in which schedules are interpreted.

[#pipelines-scheduled-to-run-specific-time-of-day]
=== Can pipelines be scheduled to run at a specific time of day?

Yes, you can set up xref:scheduled-pipelines#[Scheduled pipelines] through the xref:scheduled-pipelines#use-project-settings[CircleCI web app], or with xref:scheduled-pipelines#use-the-api[CircleCI API v2].

If you are currently using xref:workflows#scheduling-a-workflow[Scheduled workflows], please see the xref:migrate-scheduled-workflows-to-scheduled-pipelines#[Migration guide] to update your scheduled workflows to scheduled pipelines.

[#scheduled-pipelines-guaranteed-to-run-time-scheduled]
=== Are scheduled pipelines guaranteed to run at precisely the time scheduled?

CircleCI provides no guarantees about precision. A schedule will be run as if the commit was pushed at the configured time.

[#scheduled-pipeline-run-later]
=== Why did my scheduled pipeline run later than expected?

There is a nuanced difference in the scheduling expression with Scheduled Pipelines, compared to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression[the Cron expression].

For example, when you express the schedule as 1 per-hour for 08:00 UTC, the scheduled pipeline will run once within the 08:00 to 09:00 UTC window. Note that it does not mean that it will run at 08:00 UTC exactly.

However, subsequent runs of the scheduled pipeline will always be run on the same time as its previous run. In other words, if a previous scheduled pipeline ran at 08:11 UTC, the next runs should also be at 08:11 UTC.

[#do-you-support-regex]
=== Do you support regex?

Not currently. Scheduled pipelines require highly deterministic inputs such as a commit SHA, branch, or tag (fully qualified, no regexes) included in the webhook, API call, or schedule.
