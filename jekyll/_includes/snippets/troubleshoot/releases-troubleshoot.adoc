[#deployment-not-showing-up]
=== Why is my Deployment/Rollout not showing up in the components tab or releases timeline view?

* Check that the Deployment/Rollout is annotated with the required labels. More information is available in the link:/docs/configure-your-kubernetes-components#[Set up guides]. If the required labels were not present, then adding them should solve the problem.

* If you are using a Deployment, check that the desired replicas is not set to `0`. Deployments with `0` replicas are not reported as releases, even if they are scaled up subsequently. The configured value can be seen on the release agent deployment in the `circleci-release-agent-system` namespace. Here is an example in which the number of desired replicas is 2:
+
[,yml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-deployment
  namespace: sample-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 2
----

* Check that the Deployment/Rollout is in a namespace managed by the release agent. This can be verified by checking the `MANAGED_NAMESPACES` environment variable on the release agent deployment in the `circleci-release-agent-system` namespace. Here is an example in which only the default namespace is being managed:
+
[,yml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: circleci-release-agent
  namespace: circleci-release-agent-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MANAGED_NAMESPACES
          value: default

[#why-stuck-in-running]
=== Why is my release is stuck in the `Running` state?

* If you are using a Deployment, check whether it was deleted before the release could complete. In this scenario, this is an expected behavior. This experience will be improved upon in future release agent updates.

* If you are using a Deployment, check whether the release agent restarted before all pods for the deployment could become ready. This is a known limitation that will be addressed in future updates of the release agent. Restarting a release agent while a release is ongoing will cause the release agent to lose track of the release status and fail to update the CircleCI services accordingly.

[#no-releases]
=== Why are no new releases are showing up? and/or why are component versions not being updated?

* Check whether the token used by the release agent has been revoked:
.. Select btn:[Releases] in the CircleCI web app sidebar
.. Click btn:[Configure Environments] to enter the release environments view
.. Click to select your environment to view valid token details, including when the token was last used.
+
If the token has been last used longer than a minute ago, then this is likely to be the problem.

* Check whether tokens are being shared between multiple release environments. This is **not** supported. Check this by following these steps:
.. Retrieve the token value from the token field in the `circleci-release-agent` secret in the `circleci-release-agent-system` namespace
.. Compare the value with the partially obscured value for the available Tokens in the CircleCI web app
+
If the token does **not** show up in the list, then it has been revoked or the value configured on the release agent is incorrect.
In either case, creating a new token and reinstalling the Release Agent with the new value should solve the issue.

[#restore-version-time-out]
=== Why is `restore version` using Helm is timing out?

The time required for a Helm-based _restore version_ to complete successfully is dependent on the specific configuration of the target component. For example, a large number of replicas will lead to a longer duration, which could cause a timeout. It is possible to specify a different timeout by adding the `circleci.com/operation-timeout` annotation to the Rollout or Deployment. The default value for this is 10 minutes. For steps see the link:/docs/release/configure-your-kubernetes-components/#operation-timeout[Configure your Kubernetes components] page.

[#restore-version-button-unavailable]
=== Why is the restore version button not available for a component version?

Check whether the component has been undeployed. If there are currently no live versions for a component, the btn:[Restore Version] button will not be visible for that component until at least one version has been deployed.

[#all-features-unavailable-on-release]
=== Why are all buttons (**Promote**, **Promote All** and **Cancel**) disabled for a release?

Check whether the release is a Rollback. If this is the case, then this is a known issue that will be solved in a future update to the CircleCI release agent.

[#commands-failing]
=== Why are all commands for my component failing?

Check if the error message is “invalid or missing project ID“. In this case the component is missing a valid link:/docs/release/configure-your-kubernetes-components/#configure-release-management[Project ID].
