| Type
| Value

| `CI`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| Boolean
| `true` (represents whether the current environment is a CI environment)

| Boolean
| `true` (represents whether the current environment is a CircleCI environment)

| `CIRCLE_BRANCH`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| String
| The name of the Git branch currently being built.

| `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| Integer
| The number of the current job. Job numbers are unique for each job.

| `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| String
| The URL for the current job on CircleCI.

| `CIRCLE_JOB`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| String
| The name of the current job.

| `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| Integer
| For jobs that run with parallelism enabled, this is the index of the current parallel run. The value ranges from 0 to (`CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL` - 1)

| `CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| Integer
| For jobs that run with parallelism enabled, this is the number of parallel runs. This is equivalent to the value of `parallelism` in your config file.

| `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| String
| An OpenID Connect token signed by CircleCI which includes details about the current job.

| `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_V2`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| String
| An OpenID Connect token signed by CircleCI which includes details about the current job.

| `CIRCLE_PR_NUMBER`
| GitHub OAuth, Bitbucket
| Integer
| The number of the associated GitHub or Bitbucket pull request. Only available on forked PRs.

| `CIRCLE_PR_REPONAME`

| `CIRCLE_PREVIOUS_BUILD_NUM`
| GitHub OAuth, GitHub App, Bitbucket, GitLab
| Integer
| The largest job number in a given branch that is less than the current job number. **Note**: The variable is not always set, and is not deterministic. It is also not set on runner executors. This variable is likely to be deprecated, and CircleCI recommends users to avoid using it.

| `CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME`
| GitHub OAuth, Bitbucket

If you must use the environment variables that are deprecated for GitLab SaaS in your GitLab pipelines, you can recreate this functionality using pipeline values in your configuration file. The following example shows how to set an environment variable `CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME` using the xref:env-vars#environment-variable-usage-options[`environment` key] and populating it with the `pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name` value:

```yaml
build:
  docker:
    - image: cimg/node:17.0
      auth:
        username: mydockerhub-user
        password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
  environment:
    CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name >>
  steps:
    - run: echo $CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME
```
