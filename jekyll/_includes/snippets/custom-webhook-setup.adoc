NOTE: Selecting a custom webhook as a pipeline trigger is generally available for orgs that integrate with CircleCI's GitHub App, and is available in "Preview" for orgs that integrate with GitHub via the xref:github-integration#[CircleCI GitHub OAuth App]. See our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-pipelines-from-anywhere-custom-webhooks-now-in-preview/49864[community forum] to request access.  To find out which GitHub account type you have, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.


. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]), select **Project Settings**, and select **Pipelines** in the sidebar.
. If there is already a pipeline set up and it uses the desired YAML configuration file, proceed to the **Triggers** step below (step 5).  If not, select **Set up pipeline**. If there is a **Connect** button, select it and follow the steps to install the CircleCI GitHub App into your GitHub organization.
. Name the new pipeline and select the repository where the CircleCI YAML configuration file is stored. Enter the file path (including the `.circleci` directory). The file path can be different than `.circleci/config.yml` (for example, `.circleci/webhook.yml`).  Save the pipeline.
. Select **Triggers** in the sidebar.
. Select btn:[Add Trigger].
. Select **Custom Webhook** from the dropdown menu.
. Select btn:[Next].

. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give a descriptive name to the source of this trigger. For example, if you're setting up a Custom Webhook to run pipelines on events from Datadog, enter 'Datadog' here.
** (Optional) Add a description.
** In the field "Pipeline to run", at the bottom of the page, select the pipeline that you created in the step above.
// The field "Pipeline to run" should be above "config branch", because it needs to be selected before entering config branch and checkout branch. This change will be made soon, Benny will update the docs as soon as the change is shipped.
** Enter the name of the branch that should be used to fetch your config file when a Custom Webhook is received.
** Enter the name of the branch that should be used to checkout your code when using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#checkout[checkout step] in config. If your config is stored in the same repository as your code, then your **Config branch** and your **Checkout branch** should have the same value.
. Select btn:[Save].
. You will see a webhook endpoint URL and secret. You can use these to set up your webhook trigger from your external source. Copy the Webhook URL and use it in your trigger source appended with the secret.
+
CAUTION: The secret will not be shown again so be sure to copy the URL before clicking **Done**.
