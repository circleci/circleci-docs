//== Machine runner rpm package installation

The easiest way to install runner on a Red Hat, CentOS, or Fedora system is to use CircleCI's pre-built packages.

. On the target machine, install the CircleCI registry.
+
```shell
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/circleci/runner/script.rpm.sh?any=true | sudo bash

```

. Next, install the `circleci-runner` package.
+
```shell
sudo yum install circleci-runner -y

```

. Open the runner config YAML file and replace `<< AUTH_TOKEN >>` with your token, using the text editor of your choice.
+
```shell
sudo vim /etc/circleci-runner/circleci-runner-config.yaml

```

. Enable and start the `circleci-runner service`, and check that it is currently running.
+
```shell
sudo systemctl enable circleci-runner
sudo systemctl start circleci-runner

# Check status
sudo systemctl status circleci-runner

```
