NOTE: If you are installing **self-hosted runners for server**, the CircleCI CLI needs to be configured using your server API key. Run `circleci setup` to configure the CLI and access the option to supply a new API token if required.

In order to install self-hosted runners, you will need to create a namespace and authentication token by performing the steps listed below. Please note that to create resource classes and tokens you need to be an organization administrator in the VCS provider.

You can view your installed runners on the inventory page in the https://app.circleci.com/[web app], by clicking *Self-Hosted Runners* on the left navigation.

. Create a namespace for your organization's self-hosted runners. *Each organization can only create a single namespace*. We suggest using a lowercase representation of your CircleCI organization's account name. If you already use orbs, this namespace should be the same namespace orbs use.
+
Use the following command to create a namespace:
+
```
circleci namespace create <name> --org-id <your-organization-id>
```
+
TIP: If your organization already has a namespace, you will receive an error if you run the above command to create a _different_ namespace. The error message returns the name of the existing namespace. In this case, move on to step 2 below, using your existing namespace.

. Create a resource class for your self-hosted runner's namespace using the following command:
+
```
circleci runner resource-class create <namespace>/<resource-class> <description> --generate-token
```
+
Make sure to replace `<namespace>` and `<resource-class>` with your org namespace and desired resource class name, respectively. You may optionally add a description.
+
Example: `circleci runner resource-class create my-namespace/my-resource-class my-description --generate-token`.
+
The resource class token is returned after the runner resource class is successfully created.
+
CAUTION: The token cannot be retrieved again, so be sure to store it safely.
