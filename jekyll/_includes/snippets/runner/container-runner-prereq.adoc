//== Container runner prerequisites

To install container runners and run jobs, you will need to have root access, and have the following set up and installed:

* link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] 1.12+
* link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] 3.x
* A Kubernetes namespace without any other workloads
* The checkout step configures Git to checkout over SSH - ensure that your cluster is configured to allow outbound connections over `port 22` if you wish to use it
* The xref:local-cli#[CircleCI CLI] if you wish to install runners from the command line
