//== Machine runner debian package installation

The easiest way to install runner on a debian or ubuntu system is to use CircleCI's pre-built packages.


. On the target machine, install the CircleCI registry. This script will automatically run `apt-get update`:
+
```shell
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/circleci/runner/script.deb.sh?any=true | sudo bash

```

. Next, install the `circleci-runner` package:
+
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y circleci-runner

```

. Replace `<< AUTH_TOKEN >>` with the token generated in the steps above. You may use your text editor to do this, or edit and run the following commands to replace the token automatically:
+
```shell
export RUNNER_AUTH_TOKEN="your-runner-auth-token-here"
sudo sed -i "s/<< AUTH_TOKEN >>/$RUNNER_AUTH_TOKEN/g" /etc/circleci-runner/circleci-runner-config.yaml
```

. If you are using CircleCI server you will need to provide the url for your install. You can do this by either setting the `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL` environment variable:
+
```shell
export CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL="your server domain"
```
+
Or by adding the url to `/etc/circleci-runner/circleci-runner-config.yaml` using text editor of your choice.
+
```yaml
api:
  auth_token: << AUTH_TOKEN >>
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation.
  url: https://your.domain.here
```

. Start the `circleci-runner service`, and check that it is currently running:
+
```shell
sudo systemctl enable circleci-runner && sudo systemctl start circleci-runner

# Check status
sudo systemctl status circleci-runner

```
