    * xref:reusing-config#[Reusable configuration] elements, including executors, commands and jobs.
    * Packaged reusable configuration, known as xref:orb-intro#[orbs].

    * Option to enable auto-cancel, within **Advanced** project settings in the web app to terminate workflows when new pipelines are triggered on non-default branches.
