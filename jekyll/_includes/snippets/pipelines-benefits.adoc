- Use pipeline parameters to trigger [conditional workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/pipeline-variables/#conditional-workflows).
- Include [resuable config]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/reusing-config/) elements, including executors, commands, jobs, as well as packaged resuable config, known as [orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/).
- You can now enable auto-cancel, within **Advanced Settings**, to abort workflows when new builds are triggered on non-default branches.

**Note**, it is important to carefully consider the impact of enabling the auto-cancel feature, for example, if you have configured automated deployment jobs on non-default branches.
