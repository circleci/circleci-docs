* Trigger a pipeline through the API with the [trigger a pipeline](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/triggerPipeline) endpoint.
* Use pipeline parameters to trigger [conditional workflows](/docs/pipeline-variables#conditional-workflows).
* Use `version 2.1` configuration, which provides access to:
    * [Reusable configuration](/docs/reusing-config) elements, including executors, commands and jobs.
    * Packaged reusable configuration, known as [orbs](/docs/orb-intro).
    * Improved configuration validation error messages.
    * Option to enable auto-cancel, within **Advanced** project settings in the web app to terminate workflows when new pipelines are triggered on non-default branches (auto-cancel is available for GitHub and Bitbucket users).

It is important to carefully consider the impact of enabling the auto-cancel feature, for example, if you have configured automated deployment jobs on non-default branches.
