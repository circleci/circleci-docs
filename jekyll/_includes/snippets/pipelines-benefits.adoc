* Use the new API endpoint to [trigger a pipeline](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/triggerPipeline)
* Use pipeline parameters to trigger [conditional workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/pipeline-variables/#conditional-workflows).
* Access to `version 2.1` config, which provides:
    * [Reusable config]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/reusing-config/) elements, including executors, commands and jobs.
    * Packaged reusable config, known as [orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/).
    * Improved config validation error messages.
    * Option to enable auto-cancel, within **Advanced Settings**, to abort workflows when new builds are triggered on non-default branches.

**Note**, it is important to carefully consider the impact of enabling the auto-cancel feature, for example, if you have configured automated deployment jobs on non-default branches.
