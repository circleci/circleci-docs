[#error-message-uncertified-orbs]
=== Why do I receive an error message when trying to use an uncertified orb?

To enable usage of _uncertified_ orbs, go to your organization's settings page, and click the _Security_ tab. Then, click yes to enable _Allow Uncertified Orbs_.

NOTE: Uncertified orbs are not tested or verified by CircleCI. Currently, only orbs created by CircleCI are considered certified. Any other orbs, including partner orbs, are not certified.

[#build-error-when-testing-locally]
=== Why do I get the following error when testing locally?

Command:
```bash
circleci build -c .circleci/jobs.yml --job test
```
Error:
```bash
Error:
You attempted to run a local build with version 2.1 of configuration.
```

To resolve this error, run `circleci config process` on your configuration and then save that configuration to disk. You then should run `circleci local execute` against the processed configuration.

[#errors-claiming-namespace-or-publishing-orbs]
=== I receive an error when attempting to claim a namespace or publish a production orb.

You may not be an organization owner/admin.

Organizations can only claim a single namespace. In order to claim a namespace for an organization the authenticating user must have owner/admin privileges within the organization.

If you do not have the required permission level you might see an error similar to below:

```shell
Error: Unable to find organization YOUR_ORG_NAME of vcs-type GITHUB: Must have member permission.: the organization 'YOUR_ORG_NAME' under 'GITHUB' VCS-type does not exist. Did you misspell the organization or VCS?
```
