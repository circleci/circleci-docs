[#backup-and-restore]
== Backup and restore

Backups of CircleCI server can be created through link:https://velero.io/[Velero] which is detailed in our xref:../operator/backup-and-restore#[Backup and Restore] documentation.

[#email-notifications]
== Email notifications

Add email notification support by adding the following to `values.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
smtp:
  host: <hostname-of-submission-server>
  user: <username-for-submission-server>
  password: <password-for-submission-server
  port: <mail-port>

[#managing-orbs]
== Managing orbs

CircleCI server installations include their own local orb registry. This registry is private to the server installation. All orbs referenced in project configs reference the orbs in the _server_ orb registry. You are responsible for maintaining orbs. This includes:

* Copying orbs from the public registry.
* Updating orbs that may have been copied previously.
* Registering your company's private orbs, if you have any.

For more information and steps to complete these tasks, see the xref:../operator/managing-orbs#[Orbs on server guide].
