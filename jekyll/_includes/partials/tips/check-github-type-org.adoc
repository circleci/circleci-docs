[TIP]
====
To find out which GitHub integration type you have, check your Organization slug at menu:Organization settings[Overview]. OAuth authenticated orgs are structured as follows:

* `github/<your-org-name>` or `gh/<your-org-name>`
* `bitbucket/<your-org-name>` or `bb/<your-org-name>`

An organization slug for a GitHub App integration is in the following format:

* `circleci/<UID>`
