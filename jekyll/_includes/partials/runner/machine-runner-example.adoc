== Machine runner configuration example

Once you have installed configuration runner, select btn:[Continue] in the CircleCI web app and you will be presented with an example configuration snippet showing a job configured to use your new self-hosted runner resource class.

The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your machine runners are:

* `machine: true`
* `resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>`

Simple example of how you could set up a job:

```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - runner
jobs:
  runner:
    machine: true
    resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"
```

The job will then execute using your self-hosted runner when you push the `.circleci/config.yml` to your VCS provider.
