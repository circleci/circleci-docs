. Define the new schedule by filling out the form, then select **Save Trigger**.

The form also provides the option of adding xref:pipeline-variables#[pipeline parameters], which are typed pipeline variables that you declare at the top level of a configuration.

If you would like to manage common schedules for multiple workflows, you will need to manually set this in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. See the xref:schedule-pipelines-with-multiple-workflows#[Schedule pipelines with multiple workflows] page for examples.
