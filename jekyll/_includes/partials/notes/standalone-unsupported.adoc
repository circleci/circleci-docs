[NOTE]
====
This feature **is supported** for orgs that use OAuth authentication. Organization homepage URLs for OAuth authenticated orgs are structured as follows:

* `app.circleci.com/organization/github/<your-org-name>` or `app.circleci.com/organization/gh/<your-org-name>`
* `app.circleci.com/organization/bitbucket/<your-org-name>` or `app.circleci.com/organization/bb/<your-org-name>`

This feature is **not supported** if your Organization homepage URL is in the following format:

* `circleci/54R3kM5RtdFE7v3sa4nWAX`.

The `54R3kM5RtdFE7v3sa4nWAX` portion of the URL is a unique identifier for your organization.
