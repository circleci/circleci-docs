As you may know, we use [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) to manage the installation wizard, licensing keys, system audit logs, software updates, and other maintenance and systems tasks for CircleCI Enterprise.

If you're experiencing any issues with Replicated, here are a few ways to debug it.

### Check the current version of Replicated installed

First, make sure you have the CLI tool for Replicated installed:

```
replicated -version
```

### Restarting Replicated and the CircleCI app

Please try restarting Replicated services. You can do this by running the following commands on the service box:

```
sudo restart replicated-ui
sudo restart replicated
sudo restart replicated-agent
```

Then, go to your services box admin (i.e. https://YOUR-CCIE-INSTALL:8800) and try restarting with "Stop Now" and "Start Now".

### Trying to login Replicated

Please try to login to Replicated. You can do this by running the following commands on the service box. You will only be asked to enter password, which is the same one used to unlock the admin (i.e.: https://YOUR-CCIE-INSTALL:8800).

```
replicated login
```

If you could login, then please run the following command too and give us the output.

```
sudo replicated apps
```

You are getting Error: `request returned Unauthorized for API route`.. error probably because you are not logged into Replicated, so please check if you are still getting the error after successful login.

### Replicated logs

You can find Replicated logs under `/var/log/replicated`.

### Output of docker ps

Replicated starts many Docker containers to run CCIE, so it may be useful to check what containers are running.

You should see something similar to this output:

```
 sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                              NAMES

```

Providing us with the output of `sudo docker ps` in service box will be helpful in diagnosing the problem.
