:page-description: A cookbook of common pipeline, workflow and job execution goals and patterns
:icons: font
:experimental:

This cookbook contains "recipes" for common pipeline, workflow and job execution goals and patterns.

== Trigger a pipeline when a PR is marked ready for review

=== Goal

You may want to run a set of high credit-consuming tests only when a pull request is ready to be taken out of "draft" -- marked as ready for review. To do this, set up a trigger for your pipeline that triggers when a pull request is marked ready for review, as follows:

=== Steps

. Set up a GitHub App pipeline you want to trigger when a PR is marked ready for review. Steps for setting up a pipeline are available in the xref:pipelines#add-or-edit-a-pipeline[Pipelines and triggers overview] page.
+
.Add pipeline options for GitHub App
image::add-pipeline.png[Add pipeline options for GitHub App]
. Set up a trigger for your pipeline and select *PR marked ready for review* under the *Run on* menu. Steps for setting up a trigger are available in the xref:pipelines#add-a-trigger[Pipelines and triggers overview] page.
+
.Run on trigger options for GitHub App triggers
image::triggers/run-on-open.png[Run on trigger options for GitHub App triggers]

=== Notes

* This option is only available for GitHub App pipelines. If you have a GitHub OAuth integration you can install the GitHub App into your GitHub org and then create GitHub App pipelines. This is a quick one-time action, as described in the xref:github-integration#installing-github-app-alongside-github-oauth-app[GitHub integration] page.

== Trigger a pipeline when a PR is merged

=== Goal

You may want to trigger a specific pipeline when a pull request is merged, for example, to run clean-up/teardown scripts. To do this, set up a trigger for a "clean-up" pipeline that is triggered when a pull request is merged.

=== Steps
. Set up a GitHub App pipeline you want to trigger when a PR is merged. Steps for setting up a pipeline are available in the xref:pipelines#add-or-edit-a-pipeline[Pipelines and triggers overview] page.

== Run a workflow only when a pull request is opened

=== Goal
You may want to configure a workflow in your pipeline that will only run on a pipeline that is triggered when a pull request is opened. To do this you can use a workflow filter.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to include a workflow that you only want to run when a PR is opened.
+
[,yml]
----
workflows:
  workflow-pr-open:
    # Only run this workflow when a PR is opened
    when: pipeline.event.name == pull_request and pipeline.event.action == opened
    jobs:
      - my-job-1
      - my-job-2
----

=== Notes

* The `pipeline.event.name` and `pipeline.event.action` variables are only available for GitHub App pipelines. If you have a GitHub OAuth integration you can install the GitHub App into your GitHub org and then create GitHub App pipelines. This is a quick one-time action, as described in the xref:github-integration#installing-github-app-alongside-github-oauth-app[GitHub integration] page.

// == Trigger a pipeline when a branch has an open PR

// You may want to only build your project when a pull request is open for the associated code changes. To do this, set up a trigger for your pipeline that is triggered when a pull request is open (this option will also build for any push to your default branch and any push to a tag), as follows:

// #TODO steps to build when there is an open PR#

// == Trigger a pipeline when a label is added to a PR

// You may want to build your project when a specific label is added to a pull request. To do this, set up a trigger for your pipeline that is triggered when the "run-ci" label is added, as follows:

// #ToDO add steps to set up a trigger when label added#

// == Trigger a pipeline when a PR is opened

// Opening a pull request is not a push event, and so using the default "All pushes" trigger no pipeline will be triggered when a PR is opened. If you would like to trigger a build when a PR is opened, you can set up a trigger for a pipeline that is triggered when a pull request is opened, as follows:

// #TODO steps to trigger on a PR being opened#

== Run a workflow only for specific branches

=== Goal
You may want to configure a workflow that will only run when the pipeline is triggered on a specific branch.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to include a workflow that will only run for specific branches.

== Run a workflow depending on the value of a boolean parameter

=== Goal
You may want to configure a workflow that will only run when a boolean pipeline parameter is true.

=== Steps

. Update config to declare a pipeline parameter with a default value of `false`

. Update you workflow config to use a when statement so the workflow will only run when the pipeline parameter is true

== Run a step depending on the output of a nested logic statement

=== Goal

You may want to configure a step that will run depending on the output of a nested logic statement.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to use xref:configuration-reference#the-when-step[the `when` step].
+
[,yaml]

== Run a job only on specific branches **or** when the value of a pipeline parameter is true

=== Goal

You may want to configure a job that only runs on specific branches or when the value of a pipeline parameter is `true` when triggered via the API.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to include an xref:configuration-reference/#expression-based-job-filters[expression-based job filter].

== Run a workflow only for scheduled pipelines with a specific name

=== Goal

In some cases, you may want to configure a workflow that will only run when a scheduled pipeline has a specific name.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to use the `pipeline.scheduled_source` and `pipeline.schedule.name` xref:pipeline-variables#pipeline-values[pipeline values].

== Run a workflow when open pull requests are modified

=== Goal

You may want to have a workflow run when a open pull requests are updated with new commits (synchronize) or labeled.

=== Steps

* Update your CircleCI config to use the `pipeline.event.name` and `pipeline.event.action` xref:pipeline-variables#pipeline-values[pipeline values].
+

== Use no-op jobs to create a cleaner workflow graph

=== Goal

You may want to organize your workflow graph to make it more readable without adding additional build time or consuming credits. Using `no-op` jobs can help create a cleaner structure for complex workflows with many dependencies.

The following snippet shows how your workflow configuration might look without using a `no-op` job:

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

  test-unit:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:unit

  test-integration:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:integration

  test-e2e:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:e2e

  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run deploy

workflows:
  build-test-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test-unit:
          requires:
            - build
      - test-integration:
          requires:
            - build
      - test-e2e:
          requires:
            - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test-unit
            - test-integration
            - test-e2e
----

Notice how the `deploy` job needs to explicitly list all three test jobs in its `requires` section. As your workflow grows, this list could become longer and more difficult to maintain.

Here is the workflow graph for this config:

image::orchestrate-and-trigger/clean-graph-before.png[Workflow graph showing snippet without `no-op` job]

=== Steps

. Add a `no-op` job to your CircleCI configuration file.
+
[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  test-coordinator:
    type: no-op

  test-unit:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:unit

  test-integration:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:integration

  test-e2e:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run test:e2e
----

. Configure your workflow to use the `no-op` job as a coordinator for downstream jobs.
+
[,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-test-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test-unit:
          requires:
            - build
      - test-integration:
          requires:
            - build
      - test-e2e:
          requires:
            - build
      - test-coordinator:
          requires:
            - test-unit
            - test-integration
            - test-e2e
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test-coordinator
----

The workflow graph will now look like this:

image::orchestrate-and-trigger/clean-graph-after.png[Workflow graph showing snippet with `no-op` job]

=== Notes

* The `no-op` job performs no actions and consumes no credits. This makes it an ideal structural element in your workflow.
* This pattern is useful when you want to visually group related jobs in the CircleCI UI.
* Using `no-op` jobs can simplify workflow management when dealing with complex dependency chains.
* Without the `test-coordinator` job, the `deploy` job would need to list all test jobs in its `requires` section.

== Simplify GitHub required status checks with no-op jobs

=== Goal

You may want to simplify the management of GitHub required status checks for your branch protection rules. Use a single `no-op` job as a gatekeeper that depends on all your critical checks. This approach is means you only need to manage a single required status check rather than multiple status checks in GitHub.

The following snippet shows how your workflow configuration might look without using a `no-op` job:

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  lint:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run lint

  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm test

  security-scan:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run security-check

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - lint
      - test
      - security-scan
----

With this configuration, in GitHub you would need to set up branch protection rules for each job (`lint`, `test`, `security-scan`). You would need to update both CircleCI config and GitHub settings when adding more jobs.

=== Steps

. Add a `no-op` job to your CircleCI configuration file that will serve as your single required status check. In this example the no-op job is `all-tests-passed`:
+
[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  all-tests-passed:
    type: no-op

  lint:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run lint

  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm test

  security-scan:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm run security-check
----

. Configure your workflow to make all critical jobs prerequisites for the `no-op` job. The `all-tests-passed` will only succeed if all its required jobs succeed.
+
[,yaml]
----
workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - lint
      - test
      - security-scan
      - all-tests-passed:
          requires:
            - lint
            - test
            - security-scan
----

. In GitHub, set up a branch protection rule to require only the `all-tests-passed` job as a required status check. See the link:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches[GitHub docs] for more information on branch protection rules.

=== Notes

* This approach simplifies branch protection management in GitHub by requiring only one status check.
* When you add new checks, you only need to update the `requires` list for your `no-op` job.
* The `no-op` job will succeed only if all its required jobs succeed.
* This pattern helps keep GitHub and CircleCI configurations in sync without manual updates.
