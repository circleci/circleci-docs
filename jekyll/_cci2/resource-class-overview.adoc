:page-description: An overview of resource classes in CircleCI
:icons: font
:experimental:

Use resource classes to:

* Specify compute resource size (CPU and RAM) for running a link:/docs/concepts/#jobs[job].
* Optimize executors based on historical trends with resource class Insights.
* Configure link:/docs/runner-concepts/#namespaces-and-resource-classes[self-hosted runners] for use in your `.circleci/config.yml` file.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

The `resource_class` configuration option has multiple uses. The most common usage is to specify CPU and RAM requirements for a job by configuring the `resource_class` key for an executor.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  my-job:
    docker: # use the Docker executor
      - image: cimg/base:2022.09 # specify a Docker image
    resource_class: xlarge # specify a resource class
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello World"
----

Executor resource classes are specified by size, for example, `small` or `medium`. Each size corresponds to specific CPU and RAM requirements. For a full list of available resource class options, see the link:/docs/configuration-reference/#resourceclass[configuration reference]. The link:https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes[resource class product page] provides information on credit usage per resource class, and resource class availability for each plan type.

When using CircleCI's self-hosted runners, use the `resource_class` key in your project configuration to specify which runner to use for a job. Self-hosted runner resource classes are assigned and configured during the xref:runner-overview/#getting-started[installation process].

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine: true
    resource_class: <my-namespace>/<my-runner>
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello runner"
----

Another use of the `resource_class` key is to specify an execution environment. For example, link:/docs/using-arm[Arm] is a resource class option when using the `machine` executor.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2004:202101-01
    resource_class: arm.medium
    steps:
      - run: uname -a
      - run: echo "Hello, Arm!"
----

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

For config examples showing how to use the `resource_class` key to **specify CPU and RAM size** for an execution environment, see the following sections of the configuration reference page:

* link:/docs/configuration-reference/#docker-execution-environment[Docker resource classes]
* link:/docs/configuration-reference/#linuxvm-execution-environment[Linux VM resource classes]
* link:/docs/configuration-reference/#macos-execution-environment[macOS resource classes]
* link:/docs/configuration-reference/#windows-execution-environment[Windows resource classes]
* GPU resource classes: link:/docs/configuration-reference/#gpu-execution-environment-linux[Linux] and link:/docs/configuration-reference/#gpu-execution-environment-windows[Windows]
* link:/docs/configuration-reference/#arm-execution-environment-linux[Arm resource classes]

To get started setting up a **self-hosted runner**, see the xref:runner-overview/#getting-started[Getting started] section of the Self-hosted runners overview.

[#default-resource-class]
== Default resource class

If a `resource_class` is not explicitly declared for a job, CircleCI will use a default resource class size. Defaults are subject to change. It is best practice to specify a resource class, rather than relying on a default.

[#resource-class-usage-tools]
== Resource class usage tools

Information about the resource classes used in your jobs can be found in the web app, or by using the API. See the sections below for details.

[#find-the-resource-class-used-for-a-job]
=== Find the resource class used for a job

The job details page in the web app shows the resource class used for a job.

Alternatively, use the "Get job details" endpoint to return information about a job, including the resource class used. For usage steps see the link:/docs/api-developers-guide/#get-job-details[get job details] how-to guide.

[#view-resource-usage-per-job]
=== View resource usage per job

{% include snippets/resource-class-view.adoc %}

=== Resource class Insights

Resource class Insights let you track resource utilization for your jobs. You can inspect and use this information to update your executors based on historical trends and job requirements.

To find resource class Insights:

. Select **Insights** from the web app sidebar.
. The dashboard shows Insights at the project level. To find resource class Insights you need to drill down to the job level:
.. Select a project from the drop down.
.. Select a workflow from the list.
.. Select the **Jobs** tab.
.. Expand a job to view the resource class Insights.
