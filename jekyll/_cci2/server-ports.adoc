WARNING: CircleCI Server version 2.x is no longer a supported release. Please consult your account team for help in upgrading to a supported release.

This section defines the system and port access requirements for installing CircleCI v2.x.

toc::[]

== Services Machine
The Services machine hosts the core of our Server product, including the user-facing website, API engine, datastores, and Nomad job scheduler. It is best practice to use an isolated machine.

NOTE: Currently, CircleCI Server only supports x86_64 architecture.

The following table defines the Services machine CPU, RAM, and disk space requirements:

[cols=5*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Number of daily active CircleCI users
| CPU

| 256GB
| 1TB
| 10Gbps

| 5000+
| 24 cores
| 512GB

== Nomad Clients

Nomad client machines run CircleCI jobs that are scheduled by the Nomad Server. The Minimum CPU, RAM, and disk space requirements per client are as follows:

- CPU: 4 cores
- RAM: 32GB
- Disk space: 100GB
- NIC speed: 1Gbps

For an AWS install of CircleCI Server, the recommended instance type for Nomad clients is `m5.2xlarge` (8 vCPUs @ 2.4GHz, 32GB RAM).

NOTE: Currently, Nomad Clients only support x86_64 architecture.

You can choose a larger instance type to fit more jobs per Client. To help in this choice, consider that when Nomad decides if a job will fit on a Client, the Job is allocated 1024MHz per CPU, and capacity is `number of cores` * `clock speed`. Using this method, the maximum capacity of a `m5.2xlarge` would be `19200MHz`, which would mean 9.6 jobs could run on that client (if there were no limiting factors). In practice, Nomad will researve some CPU for itself, and because of the CPU:RAM ratio, the available RAM is the limiting factor governing how many jobs can run.

=== Recommendations for Heavy Usage

EBS will throttle IOPS after certain IO operations, therefore heavy-load usage with the default Server configuration (m5.2xlarge with 200-GiB gp2 root volume) can see performance-related issues, such as slow jobs, slow spin-up, and job timeouts in worst cases.

To give an idea of what is meant by heavy usage:

* If `BurstBalance` metrics for storage attached to Nomad clients are decreasing sharply, this is a sign that the workload is heavy enough to be affected. See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using_cloudwatch_ebs.html#ebs-volume-metrics[AWS EBS metrics document] for further details.
* We have had a report from a customer that continuous disk I/O at 500 MB/s used up the burst credits for our default storage configuration within 37.5 minutes.

Suggested workarounds for this issue are as follows:

* Use EBS volumes larger than 1 TiB. Large EBS volumes never consume IO credits.
* Use the *5d instance type and use an attached instance store for Docker-related files (i.e. /var/lib/docker).

== Choosing Nomad Client Quantity

The following table defines the number of Nomad clients to make available as a best practice. Scale up and down according to demand on your system:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Number of daily active CircleCI users
| Number of Nomad client machines

| <50
| 1-5

| 50-250
| 5-10

| 250-1000
| 10-15

| 5000+
| 15+

== Server Ports
