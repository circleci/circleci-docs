[#introduction]
== Introduction

This orb authoring guide assumes you have read the xref:orb-intro#[Introduction to orbs] document, the xref:orb-author-intro#[Introduction to authoring an orb] document, and claimed your namespace. Now you are ready to develop an orb.

Whether you are writing your first orb or getting ready for production level, we recommend using our <<orb-development-kit>> to get started. Alternatively, as orbs are packages of xref:reusing-config#[reusable configuration], they can be written xref:orb-author-validate-publish#[manually], as singular `yaml` files, and published using our xref:local-cli#installation[CircleCI orb CLI].

[#orb-development-kit]
== Orb development kit

The orb development kit refers to a suite of tools that work together to simplify the orb development process, with automatic testing and deployment on CircleCI. The `orb init` command is the key to using the orb development kit. This command initiates a new orb project based on a template, and that template uses the other tools in the kit to automatically test and deploy your orb.

The orb development kit is made up of the following components:

* link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template[Orb Template]
* link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/[CircleCI CLI]
** link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_pack.html[Orb Pack Command]
** link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_init.html[Orb Init Command]
* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/orb-tools[Orb Tools Orb]

The *orb template* is a repository with CircleCI's orb project template, which is automatically ingested and modified by the `orb init` command.

The *CircleCI CLI* contains two commands which are designed to work with the kit. The *orb init command* initializes a new orb project, and the *orb pack command* packs the orb source into a single `orb.yml` file.

The *orb tools orb* is an orb for creating orbs.

[#create-test-and-publish-an-orb]
== Create, test and publish an orb

Follow the steps below to create, test and publish your own orb, using the orb development kit.

[#getting-started]
=== Getting started

To get started with orb authoring, first follow the xref:create-an-orb#[Create an orb tutorial].

[#writing-your-orb]
=== Writing your orb

Before you begin working on your orb, ensure you are on a non-default branch. We typically recommend starting your orb on the `alpha` branch.

[,shell]
----
$ git branch

* alpha
  main
----

If you have run the `circleci orb init` command, you will automatically be in the `alpha` branch and have a repository with `.circleci` and `src` directories.

[#orb-source]
==== Orb source

Navigate to the `src` directory to look at the included sections.

|===

The directories listed above represent orb components that can be included with your orb. @orb.yml acts as the root of your orb. In addition to the directories representing your orb's YAML components, you will also see a <<scripts,`scripts`>> directory where we can store code we want to inject into our components.

Each directory within `src` corresponds with a xref:reusing-config#[reusable configuration] component type, which can be added or removed from the orb. If, for example, your orb does not require any `executors` or `jobs`, these directories can be deleted.

[#orbyml]
===== @orb.yml

@orb.yml acts as the "root" to your orb project and contains the config version, the orb description, the display key, and imports any additional orbs if needed.

Use the `display` key to add clickable links to the orb registry for both your `home_url` (the home of the product or service), and `source_url` (the git repository URL).

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

description: >
  Sample orb description

display:
  home_url: "https://www.website.com/docs"
  source_url: "https://www.github.com/EXAMPLE_ORG/EXAMPLE_PROJECT"
----

[#commands]
===== Commands

Author and add xref:reusing-config#authoring-reusable-commands[Reusable Commands] to the `src/commands` directory. Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb command, with a name which matches its filename.

This example shows a simple command which contains a single `run` step, which will echo "hello" and the value passed in the `target` parameter.

[,yaml]
----
description: >
  # What will this command do?
  # Descriptions should be short, simple, and clear.
parameters:
  target:
    type: string
    default: "Hello"
    description: "To whom to greet?"
steps:
  - run:
      name: Hello World
      environment:
        ORB_PARAM_TARGET: << parameters.target >>
      command: echo "Hello ${ORB_PARAM_TARGET}"
----

[#examples]
===== Examples

Author and add xref:orb-concepts#usage-examples[Usage Examples] to the `src/examples` directory. Usage Examples are not for use directly by end users in their project configs, but they provide a way for you, the orb developer, to share use-case specific examples on the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry] for users to reference.

Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb usage example, with a name which matches its filename.

View a full example from the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template/tree/main/src/examples[Orb Template].

[#executors]
===== Executors

Author and add xref:reusing-config#authoring-reusable-executors[Parameterized Executors] to the `src/executors` directory.

Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb executor, with a name that matches its filename.

View a full example from the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template/tree/main/src/executors[Orb Template].

[#jobs]
===== Jobs

Author and add xref:reusing-config#authoring-parameterized-jobs[Parameterized Jobs] to the `src/jobs` directory.

Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb job, with a name that matches its filename.

Jobs can include orb commands and other steps to fully automate tasks with minimal user configuration.

View the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template/blob/main/src/jobs/hello.yml[hello.yml] job example from the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/Orb-Template/tree/main/src/jobs[Orb Template].

[,yaml]
----
description: >
  # What will this job do?
  # Descriptions should be short, simple, and clear.

docker:
  - image: cimg/base:current
parameters:
  greeting:
    type: string
    default: "Hello"
    description: "Select a proper greeting"
steps:
  - greet:
      greeting: "<< parameters.greeting >>"
----

[#scripts]
==== Scripts

One of the major benefits of the orb development kit is a xref:orb-concepts#file-include-syntax[script inclusion] feature. When using the `circleci orb pack` command in the CLI (automated when using the orb development kit), you can use the value `<<include(file)>>` within your orb config code, for any key, to include the file contents directly in the orb.

Script inclusion is especially useful when writing complex orb commands, which might contain a lot of _Bash_ code, _(although you could use Python too!)_.

[#why-include-scripts]
===== Why include scripts?

CircleCI configuration is written in `YAML`. Logical code such as `bash` can be encapsulated and executed on CircleCI through `YAML`, but, for developers, it is not convenient to write and test programmatic code within a non-executable format. Also, parameters can become cumbersome in more complex scripts as the `<<parameter>>` syntax is a CircleCI native YAML enhancement, and not something that can be interpreted and executed locally.

Using the orb development kit and the `<<include(file)>>` syntax, you can import existing scripts into your orb, locally execute and test your orb scripts, and even utilize true testing frameworks for your code.

[#using-parameters-with-scripts]
===== Using parameters with scripts

To keep your scripts portable and locally executable, it is best practice to expect a set of environment variables within your scripts and set them at the config level. The `greet.sh` file, which was included with the special `<<include(file)>>` syntax above in our `greet.yml` command file, looks like this:

[,shell]
----
echo Hello "${PARAM_TO}"
----

This way, you can both mock and test your scripts locally.

[#testing-orbs]
=== Testing orbs

Much like any software, to ensure quality updates, we must test our changes. Various tools are available for testing your orb, from simple validation, to unit and integration testing.

In the `.circleci/` directory created by the orb development kit, you will find a `config.yml` file and a `test-deploy.yml` file. You will find in the `config.yml` file, the different static testing methods we apply to orbs, such as linting, shellchecking, reviewing, validating, and in some cases, unit testing. While, the `test-deploy.yml` config file is used to test a development version of the orb for integration testing.

Read our full xref:testing-orbs#[Orb Testing Methodologies] documentation.

[#publishing-your-orb]
=== Publishing your orb

With the orb development kit, a fully automated CI and CD pipeline is automatically configured within `.circleci/config.yml`. This configuration makes it simple to automatically deploy semantically versioned releases of your orbs.

For more information, see the xref:creating-orbs#[Orb Publishing Process] guide.

[#listing-your-orbs]
=== Listing your orbs

List your available orbs using the CLI:

To list xref:orb-intro#public-or-private[public] orbs:

[,shell]
----
circleci orb list <my-namespace>
----

To list xref:orb-intro#public-or-private[private] orbs:

[,shell]
----
circleci orb list <my-namespace> --private
----

For more information on how to use the `circleci orb` command, see the CLI link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb.html[documentation].

[#categorizing-your-orb]
=== Categorizing your orb

NOTE: Orb categorization is *not* available on installations of CircleCI server.

You can categorize your orb for better discoverability in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry]. Categorized orbs are searchable by category in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry]. CircleCI may, from time to time, create or edit orb categorizations to improve orb discoverability.

[#listing-categories]
==== Listing categories

image::orb-categories-list-categories.png[Example of showing listing categories using the CLI]

You can select up to two categories for your orb. These are the available categories:

* Artifacts/Registry
* Build
* Cloud Platform
* Code Analysis
* Collaboration
* Containers
* Deployment
* Infra Automation
* Kubernetes
* Language/Framework
* Monitoring
* Notifications
* Reporting
* Security
* Testing

The list of categories can also be obtained by running the `circleci orb list-categories` CLI command. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_list-categories.html[here].

[#add-an-orb-to-a-category]
==== Add an orb to a category

image::orb-categories-add-to-category.png[Adding an orb category]

Add your orb to your chosen category by running `circleci orb add-to-category <namespace>/<orb> "<category-name>"`. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_add-to-category.html[here].

[#remove-an-orb-from-a-category]
==== Remove an orb from a category

image::orb-categories-remove-from-category.png[Removing an orb from a category]

Remove an orb from a category by running `circleci orb remove-from-category <namespace>/<orb> "<category-name>"`. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_remove-from-category.html[here].

[#viewing-an-orbs-categorizations]
==== Viewing an orb's categorizations

image::orb-categories-orb-info.png[Show which categorizations have been added to an orb]

To see which categorizations have been applied an orb, check the output of `circleci orb info <namespace>/<orb>` for a list. You can view the detailed docs for this command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_info.html[here].
