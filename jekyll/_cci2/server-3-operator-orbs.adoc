This section describes orbs and how to manage them. Server installations include their own local orb registry. This registry
is private to the server installation. All orbs referenced in configs reference the orbs in the server orb registry. You
are responsible for maintaining orbs. This includes copying orbs from the public registry, updating orbs that may have
been copied prior, and registering your companies private orbs if they exist.

## Managing Orbs
Orbs are accessed via the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/[CircleCI CLI]. Orbs require your CircleCI user to be
an admin. They also require a personal api token https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/. Providing a local
repository location using the `--host` option allows you to access your local server orbs vs the public cloud orbs. For
example, if your server installation is located at `\http://circleci.somehostname.com`, then you can run orb commands
local to that orb repository by passing `--host \http://cirlceci.somehostname.com`.

## List available orbs
To list available public orbs, visit the orb directory or run:

[source,bash]
----
circleci orb list
----

To list available private orbs (registered in your local server orb repository) run:
[source,bash]
----
circleci orb list --host <your server install domain> --token <your api token>
----

## Import a public orb
To import a public orb to your local server orb repository:

```bash
circleci admin import-orb ns[orb[@version]] --host <your server installation domain> --token <your api token>
```

## Fetch a public orbâ€™s updates
To update a public orb in your local server orb repository with a new version, run:

[source,bash]
----
circleci admin import-orb ns[orb[@version]] --host <your server installation domain> --token <your api token>
----

## Using orbs behind a proxy

When importing orbs, the CLI must be able to talk to the server installation and to circleci.com. If you want to do this when using a server installation behind a proxy, the CLI needs to be configured to use the proxy to make those requests to `circleci.com` and to not proxy requests to the server install. Here is an example of how this could look:

```bash
export NO_PROXY=server.example.com
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128
circleci admin import-orb ns[orb[@version]] --host <your server installation domain> --token <your api token>
```

For more orb information on using and authoring orbs, refer to the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/#quick-start[Orb docs] for the cloud product.
