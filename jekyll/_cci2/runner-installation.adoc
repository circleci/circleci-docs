NOTE: CircleCI runner is available on the https://circleci.com/pricing[Scale
plan] and with https://circleci.com/pricing/server/[server]. Please reach out
to your sales representative (or https://circleci.com/contact-us/?cloud[contact
us]) for information on how to sign up for the Scale plan or server.

This page describes how to install CircleCI runner on Linux, macOS, Docker, and Windows platforms. For other platforms, see xref:runner-overview.adoc#available-circleci-runner-platforms[Available CircleCI runner platforms] for more information.

toc::[]

== Prerequisites

The installation process assumes you have installed the following utilities on your system:

* <<local-cli#installation,CircleCI CLI>>
* curl (installed by default on macOS)
* sha256sum (installed as part of coreutils on Linux apt/yum, macOS via brew)
* systemd version 235+ (Linux only)
* sepolicy (RHEL 8 only)
* rpmbuild (RHEL 8 only)
* permissions to create a user, and create directories under /opt.

== Authentication

NOTE: These commands can only be run by an owner/admin of your organization.

In order to complete this process you will need to create a namespace and authentication token by performing the steps listed below:

. Create a namespace for your organization's runner resources.
+
NOTE: Each organization can only create a single namespace. If you already use orbs, this namespace will be the same namespace as the orbs use. 
+ 
Use the following command: 
+
```
circleci namespace create <name> <vcs-type> <org-name>
```
+
For example, if your GitHub URL is `https://github.com/circleci`, then use: `circleci namespace create my-namespace github circleci`.
. Create a resource class for your runner for your namespace using the following command:
+ 
```
circleci runner resource-class create <resource-class> <description>
``` 
+
For example, `circleci runner resource-class create my-namespace/my-resource-class my-description`.
+
NOTE: To create resource classes and tokens you need to be an organization administrator in the VCS provider.
. Create a token for authenticating the above resource-class using the following command: 
+
```
circleci runner token create <resource-class> <nickname>
``` 
+
For example, `circleci runner token create my-namespace/my-resource-class my-token`. This will print a generated runner configuration including the authentication token.

CAUTION: The token cannot be retrieved again, so be sure to store it safely.

== Job running requirements

Running jobs requires you have the following tools available on your machine:

* tar
* gzip
* coreutils (Linux only)
* git (recommended, but not required)

== Installation

=== Download the launch agent binary and verify the checksum
[[download]]
The launch agent can be installed using the following script, which will use `opt/circleci` as the base install location.

First, set one of these variables as appropriate for for your installation target.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Installation Target
| Variable

| For Linux x86_64
| `platform=linux/amd64`

| For Linux ARM64
| `platform=linux/arm64`

| For macOS x86_64
| `platform=darwin/amd64`

| For macOS M1
| `platform=darwin/arm64`
|===

Next, set the `circleci-launch-agent` version. Runners on cloud auto-update to the latest supported versions. For server, specific runner versions are validated for interoperability and runners do not auto-update. A table of server `circleci-launch-agent` versions can be found <<runner-for-server-compatibility,here>>.

For cloud, you can run the following:
```bash
export base_url="https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-launch-agent"
export agent_version=$(curl "${base_url}/release.txt")
```

For server v3.1.0 and up, run the following, substituting `<launch-agent-version>` with the correct launch agent version for the version of server you are running (see <<runner-for-server-compatibility>> to find the correct version):
```bash
export agent_version="<launch-agent-version>"
```

Finally, run the following script to download, verify and install the binary.
```bash
# Set up runner directory
prefix=/opt/circleci
sudo mkdir -p "$prefix/workdir"

# Downloading launch agent
echo "Using CircleCI Launch Agent version $agent_version"
echo "Downloading and verifying CircleCI Launch Agent Binary"
base_url="https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-launch-agent"
curl -sSL "$base_url/$agent_version/checksums.txt" -o checksums.txt
file="$(grep -F "$platform" checksums.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed 's/^.//')"
mkdir -p "$platform"
echo "Downloading CircleCI Launch Agent: $file"
curl --compressed -L "$base_url/$agent_version/$file" -o "$file"

# Verifying download
echo "Verifying CircleCI Launch Agent download"
grep "$file" checksums.txt | sha256sum --check && chmod +x "$file"; sudo cp "$file" "$prefix/circleci-launch-agent" || echo "Invalid checksum for CircleCI Launch Agent, please try download again"
```

=== Platform-specific instructions

Please refer to the platform-specific installation instructions:

* <<CircleCI Runner Installation (Linux), Linux>>
* <<CircleCI Runner Installation (macOS), macOS>>
* <<Docker Installation, Docker>>
* <<Windows Installation, Windows>>

== CircleCI Runner Installation (Linux)

=== Create the CircleCI runner configuration

The recommended CircleCI runner configuration for Linux is:

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation. For example,
  # url: https://circleci.example.com

runner:
  name: RUNNER_NAME
  command_prefix: ["sudo", "-niHu", "circleci", "--"]
  working_directory: /opt/circleci/workdir/%s
  cleanup_working_directory: true
```

Replace `AUTH_TOKEN` with the token created in the <<#authentication,Authentication step>>. `RUNNER_NAME` can be anything you would like although should be unique among all other runners used by the same resource class.

=== Install the CircleCI runner configuration

Once created, save the configuration file to `/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml` owned by `root` with permissions `600`.

```bash
sudo chown root: /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
sudo chmod 600 /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

=== Create the circleci user & working directory

These will be used when executing the task agent. These commands must be run as a user with permissions to create other users (e.g. `root`). For information about GECOS, see the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field[wiki page].

==== Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
id -u circleci &>/dev/null || adduser --uid 1500 --disabled-password --gecos GECOS circleci

mkdir -p /opt/circleci/workdir
chown -R circleci /opt/circleci/workdir
```

==== CentOS/RHEL

```bash
id -u circleci &>/dev/null || adduser --uid 1500 -c GECOS circleci

mkdir -p /opt/circleci/workdir
chown -R circleci /opt/circleci/workdir
```

=== Configure SELinux policy (RHEL 8)

An SELinux policy is required for runner to accept and launch jobs on RHEL 8 systems (earlier versions of RHEL are unsupported). Note that this policy does not add any permissions to the ones that may be required by individual jobs on this runner install.

Create directory `/opt/circleci/policy` and generate the initial policy module:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/circleci/policy

# Install sepolicy and rpmbuild if you haven't already
sudo yum install -y policycoreutils-devel
sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo sepolicy generate --path /opt/circleci/policy --init /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent
```

Download the following type enforcing file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te[`circleci_launch_agent.te`] and install the policy:

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te --output /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.te

sudo /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.sh
```

=== Enable the `systemd` unit

Create `/opt/circleci/circleci.service` owned by `root` with permissions `755`.

You must ensure that `TimeoutStopSec` is greater than the total amount of time a task will run for - which defaults to 5 hours.

If you want to configure the CircleCI runner installation to start on boot, it is important to note that the launch agent will attempt to consume and start jobs as soon as it starts, so it should be configured appropriately before starting. The launch agent may be configured as a service and be managed by systemd with the following scripts:

```
[Unit]
Description=CircleCI Runner
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
Restart=always
User=root
NotifyAccess=exec
TimeoutStopSec=18300
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

You can now enable the service:

```bash
systemctl enable /opt/circleci/circleci.service
```

=== Start the service

When the CircleCI runner service starts, it will immediately attempt to start running jobs, so it should be fully configured before the first start of the service.

```bash
systemctl start circleci.service
```

=== Verify the service is running

The system reports a very basic health status through the `Status` field in `systemctl`. This will report **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** based on connectivity to the CircleCI APIs.

You can see the status of the agent by running:

```bash
systemctl status circleci.service --no-pager
```

Which should produce output similar to:

```
circleci.service - CircleCI Runner
   Loaded: loaded (/opt/circleci/circleci.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-05-29 14:33:31 UTC; 18min ago
 Main PID: 5592 (circleci-launch)
   Status: "Healthy"
    Tasks: 8 (limit: 2287)
   CGroup: /system.slice/circleci.service
           └─5592 /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

You can also see the logs for the system by running:

```bash
journalctl -u circleci
```

== CircleCI Runner Installation (macOS)

=== Create a CircleCI runner configuration

Choose a user to run the CircleCI agent. These instructions refer to the selected user as `USERNAME`.

Complete the template shown below, with the various capitalized parameters filled in. When complete, save the template as `launch-agent-config.yaml`.

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation. For example,
  # url: https://circleci.example.com

runner:
  name: RUNNER_NAME
  command_prefix : ["sudo", "-niHu", "USERNAME", "--"]
  working_directory: /tmp/%s
  cleanup_working_directory: true

logging:
  file: /Library/Logs/com.circleci.runner.log
```

=== Install the CircleCI Runner configuration

Create a directory as `root` to hold the CircleCI runner configuration:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p '/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner'
```

Copy the previously created `launch-agent-config.yaml` into the directory:

```bash
sudo cp 'launch-agent-config.yaml' '/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/launch-agent-config.yaml'
```

=== Install the `launchd .plist`

Copy the following to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist`, owned by `root`, with permissions `644`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.circleci.runner</string>

        <key>Program</key>
        <string>/opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent</string>

        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>circleci-launch-agent</string>
            <string>--config</string>
            <string>/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/launch-agent-config.yaml</string>
        </array>

        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>

        <!-- The agent needs to run at all times -->
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <true/>

        <!-- This prevents macOS from limiting the resource usage of the agent -->
        <key>ProcessType</key>
        <string>Interactive</string>

        <!-- Increase the frequency of restarting the agent on failure, or post-update -->
        <key>ThrottleInterval</key>
        <integer>3</integer>

        <!-- Wait for 10 minutes for the agent to shut down (the agent itself waits for tasks to complete) -->
        <key>ExitTimeOut</key>
        <integer>600</integer>

        <!-- The agent uses its own logging and rotation to file -->
        <key>StandardOutPath</key>
        <string>/dev/null</string>
        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
        <string>/dev/null</string>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

=== Enable the `launchd` service

If you are following these instructions for a second time, you should unload the following existing service:

```bash
sudo launchctl unload '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
```

Now you can load the service:

```bash
sudo launchctl load '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
```

=== Verify the service is running

The macOS application console can be used to view the logs for the CircleCI agent. Look under "Log Reports" for the logs called `com.circleci.runner.log`.

== Docker Installation

The host needs to have Docker installed. Once the `runner` container is started, the container will immediately attempt to start running jobs. The container will be reused to run more jobs indefinitely until it is stopped.

The number of containers running in parallel on the host is constrained by the host's available resources and your jobs' performance requirements.

=== Create a Dockerfile that extends the CircleCI Runner image

In this example, python3 is installed on top of the base image.

`Dockerfile.runner.extended`

```
FROM circleci/runner:launch-agent
RUN apt-get update; \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
        python3
```

=== Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build --file ./Dockerfile.runner.extended .
```

=== Start the Docker container

NOTE: The environment variable values are not available to the `docker` command, so these environment variables are not visible in `ps` output.

```bash
CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS=<resource-class> CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN=<runner-token> docker run --env CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN --env CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS --name <container-name> <image-id-from-previous-step>
```

When the container starts, it will immediately attempt to start running jobs.

==== Start the Docker container on server

When starting the docker container on server, the `agent_version` environment variable will need to be passed in using the `--env` flag.

``` bash
CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS=<resource-class> CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN=<runner-token> agent_version=<agent_version_for_server> docker run --env agent_version --env CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN --env CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS --name <container-name> <image-id-from-previous-step>
```

=== Stopping the Docker container

``` bash
docker stop <container-name>
```

=== Remove the Docker container

In some cases you might need to fully remove a stopped runner container from the system, such as when recreating a container using the same name.

``` bash
docker stop <container-name>; docker rm <container-name>;
```

== Windows Installation

NOTE: This has been tested for Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2016, both in Datacenter Edition with Desktop Experience.

With this procedure, you install CircleCI Launch Agent and its dependencies, i.e., Chocolatey, Git and Gzip, on your Windows Server.

Since this setup creates a new local administrator user that runs CircleCI jobs, your Windows Server needs to be capable of creating local users and accepting remote logons for them.

* The Windows Server needs to be a domain member when you set this up in domain environments. The runner instance cannot run on a Windows Server operating as a domain controller.

=== Installation Steps

. Download the https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/tree/main/windows-install[`Install-CircleCIRunner.ps1` script] from Github to an easily accessible location. 

. Open PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to the directory where you placed the script file.

. Run the following in your PowerShell:
+
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; 
./Install-CircleCIRunner.ps1
```
+
The installation will be output into your PowerShell interface.

. As part of the installation, the configuration file for the Runner (`launch-agent-config.yaml`) will open in Notepad. Please fill the file out with the requested information (see <<Configuration file reference, Configuration file reference>>). The configuration file is located in the installation directory - `C:\Program Files\CircleCI`, by default.

After setup completes, the Launch Agent starts automatically and begins looking for jobs to process.

== Kubernetes Installation

See: xref:runner-on-kubernetes.adoc[Runner on Kubernetes]

== Configuration file reference

A YAML file is used to configure the launch agent, how it communicates with our servers and how it will launch the task agent.

The configuration file uses the following format with the various parameters explained in more detail below:

```sh
api:
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN
runner:
  name: RUNNER_NAME
```

==== runner.name

`RUNNER_NAME` is a unique name assigned to this particular running launch agent. CircleCI recommends using the hostname of the machine so that it can be used to identify the agent when viewing statuses and job results in the CircleCI UI.

==== api.auth_token

This is a token used to identify the launch agent to CircleCI and can be generated by the CircleCI CLI. An existing token may be shared among many installations, but this token only allows a particular `resource_class` to be specified.

==== runner.command_prefix

This prefix enables you to customize how the task agent process is launched. Using a custom script here can allow you to execute arbitrary commands before and after the task runner. You should take care to ensure the supplied arguments are executed, and the correct exit code is returned from the script upon completion.

==== runner.working_directory

This directory allows you to control the default working directory used by each job. If the directory already exists, task agent will need permissions to write to the directory. If the directory does not exist, then the task agent will need permissions to create the directory. If `%s` is present in the value, this value will be replaced with a different value for each job. Note that these directories will not be automatically removed.

==== runner.cleanup_working_directory

This directory enables you to control the working directory cleanup after each job. The default value is `false`.

==== runner.max_run_time

This value can be used to override the default maximum duration the task agent will run each job. Note that the value is a string with the following unit identifiers `h`, `m` or `s` for hour minute and seconds respectively:

Here are few valid examples:

* `72h` - 3 days
* `1h30m` - 1 hour 30 minutes
* `30s` - 30 seconds
* `50m` - 50 minutes
* `1h30m20s` - An overly specific (yet still valid) duration.

NOTE: The default value is 5 hours.

===== Customizing job timeouts and drain timeouts

If you would like to customize the job timeout setting, you can "drain" the job by sending the Launch Agent a termination (TERM) signal, which then causes the Launch Agent to attempt to gracefully shutdown. When this TERM signal is received, the launch agent enters 'draining' mode, preventing the Launch Agent from accepting any new jobs, but still allowing any current active job to be completed. At the end of "draining," the Launch Agent then signals the Task Agent to cancel any active job (by sending it a TERM signal).

NOTE: If the Task Agent does not exit a brief period after the TERM, the Launch Agent will manually kill it by sending it a KILL signal.

Draining can end in one of two ways:

* The task has been in the draining state for longer than the configured `max_run_time`.
* An additional TERM signal is received by the Launch Agent during "draining".

== Runner for Server Compatibility
_CircleCI Runner is available from server v3.1.0_

Each minor version of server is compatible with a specific version of
`circleci-launch-agent`. The table below lists which version of `circleci-launch-agent` to use when installing runner,
depending on your version of server:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Server version  
| Launch Agent Version

| 3.0             
| Runner not supported

| 3.1            
| 1.0.11147-881b608
