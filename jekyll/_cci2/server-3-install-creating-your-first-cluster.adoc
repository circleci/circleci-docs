If you have never previously set up a Kubernetes cluster, we have provided some tips in this section.

## Step 1 - Create

### Amazon EKS

CircleCI recommends using `eksctl` to set up your first cluster on AWS. `eksctl` will take care of VPC creation, in addition
to security group selection.

Before creating the cluster, make sure you have the following:

. The latest AWS CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html[installed] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configured] to your AWS account
. `eksctl` https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html[installed]
. `kubectl` https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html[installed]

#### Create a cluster using flags

To create a simple cluster, you can run the command:

`eksctl create cluster`

Additional flags are available on the command line. See the `eksctl` https://eksctl.io/introduction/[introduction] for more information.

#### Create cluster using a configuration file

You can also create a config file for your cluster, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: <your-cluster-name>
  region: <aws-region>

managedNodeGroups:
  - name: <nodegroup-name-1>
    instanceType: <instance-type> # i.e., m5.large. see https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ for available instance types
    minSize: 4 # see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-group.html#cfn-as-group-minsize for more information
    maxSize: 6 # see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-group.html#cfn-as-group-maxsize for more information
----

For more examples on cluster configuration files, see https://eksctl.io[eksctl.io].

When you are finished with your configuration, save it and run:

`eksctl create cluster -f <your-cluster-config.yaml>`

[TIP]
====
When using the `eksctl` tool to create your cluster, you may receive an AWS STS access error: `AWS STS access â€“ cannot get role ARN for current session: InvalidClientTokenId.`

This may mean your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html[AWS credentials] are invalid,
or your IAM user does not have permission to create an EKS cluster. Note that the proper IAM permissions are necessary in
order to use `eksctl`. See the AWS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html#eksctl-prereqs[documentation]
regarding prerequisite IAM permissions.
====

## Step 2 - Verify

Once your cluster is finished being created, you should be able to run various `kubectl` commands to view your cluster resources.

For instance, to view your cluster's https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/#discovering-builtin-services[built-in services], you can run:

`kubectl cluster-info`

Or, to verify that your cluster has worker nodes attached, run:

`kubectl get nodes -o wide`

For more information on exploring your new cluster, see the following:
