To run your very first CircleCI build on the CircleCI 2.0 platform, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the [Sign Up](https://circleci.com/signup/) page.

2. Click one of the Start buttons on the page to begin logging in or to start the process of allowing CircleCI to access your code on GitHub or Bitbucket. To limit CircleCI from accessing your private GitHub repositories, select Public Repos Only from the Start with Github menu when you sign up and on every subsequent login.

3. Type your GitHub or Bitbucket username, password, and two-factor authorization if applicable, then click Sign In/Login.

4. Click the Authorize Application or equivalent button. The CircleCI Builds Dashboard appears. 

5. Use the Project Setup pages of the CircleCI app to start building your project code.
