To run your very first build on CircleCI, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the [Sign Up](https://circleci.com/signup/){:target="_blank"} page.

2. Click on either **Sign Up with GitHub** or **Sign Up with Bitbucket** to start the authentication process and allow CircleCI to access your code. **Note:** if you are using GitHub you have the option to limit CircleCI, preventing access to your private repositories. To do this, use the drop down menu at the side of the Sign Up button, and select Public Repos Only from the list.

3. Type your GitHub or Bitbucket username, password, and two-factor authorization if applicable, then click Sign In/Login.

4. Click the Authorize Application or equivalent button. The CircleCI Pipelines Dashboard appears.

5. Use the Add Project page of the CircleCI app to start building your project code.
