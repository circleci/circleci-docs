If you are already a CircleCI 1.0 user, go to [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/hello-world/) to learn about adding the `.circleci/config.yml` file that enables 2.0 builds. If you are building on 2.0 and want to learn about Workflows, see [Orchestrating Workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows/). 

## Steps

To run your very first CircleCI build on the CircleCI 2.0 platform, complete the following steps:

1. Click the [Sign Up](https://circleci.com/signup/) button.

2. Click one of the Start buttons on the page to begin logging in or to start the process of allowing CircleCI to access your code on GitHub or Bitbucket. To limit CircleCI from accessing your private GitHub repositories, select Public Repos Only from the Start with Github menu when you sign up and on every subsequent login.

3. Type your GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google username, password, and two-factor authorization if applicable, then click Sign In/Login.

4. Click the Authorize Application or equivalent button.

The CircleCI Builds Dashboard appears. If you provided access to your GitHub or Bitbucket repositories, you are ready to configure CircleCI for your project. See the [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/hello-world/) doc to configure your first simple 2.0 build. If you signed in with a Google account, you are able to try out the application and selected demo projects before authorizing access to your code.
