:toc-title:

The dedicated host resource class is a new macOS option for those developing, building, testing, and signing iOS, iPadOS, macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS applications using the Xcode IDE. These dedicated resources provide an isolated environment for increased security.

This resource class requires a 24-hour minimum lease and runs on Intel-based Mac hardware.

The identifier for the dedicated host resource is `macos.x86.metal.gen1`, and supports the same Xcode images as the other macOS resource classes, with the exception of Xcode 10.3. Refer to the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/testing-ios/#supported-xcode-versions[Supported Xcode versions section] of the Testing iOS page for the full list of versions.

Each account has a maximum of one dedicated host by default. You can increase the maximum number by contacting https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[CircleCI support], or your account representative.

Once a dedicated host has been allocated, you have exclusive access to it for a minimum of 24 hours. If the dedicated host is already in use when a job is kicked off, the job is queued until the host becomes available, unless you have increased your dedicated host limit.

== Known limitations

- The resource class does not currently support test splitting or parallelism.
- The host gets cleaned between jobs, which can currently take 5 to 45 minutes. We recommend running more than one dedicated host concurrently to help minimize the impact of this scrubbing process. Contact support or your account representative to increase your limit.

== Example configuration file using macOS dedicated host resources

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1

  build-and-test: 
    macos:
      xcode: 12.5.1 # indicate our selected version of Xcode
    resource_class: macos.x86.metal.gen1 # dedicated host, with 24-hour billing

== FAQ

*Q:* How does a dedicated host differ from the other macOS resources on CircleCI?

*A:* CircleCI's other macOS resources are run on isolated virtual machines, which means that multiple customers can be using VMs on the same host. Dedicated hosts provide exclusive access to an entire host, without worrying about sharing resources with other customers.

*Q:* Why is there a 24-hour minimum?

*A:* Apple released an https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSBigSur.pdf[updated end-user license agreement (EULA)] along with the release of Big Sur in November 2020, which requires cloud providers to lease Apple hardware to no more than one customer for a minimum of 24 hours.
