:page-description: Browser Testing on CircleCI
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:

This page describes common methods for running and debugging browser testing in your CircleCI config.

[#overview]
== Overview

Every time you commit and push code, CircleCI automatically runs all of your tests against the browsers you choose. You can configure your browser-based tests to run:

* Whenever a change is made
* Before every deployment
* On a specified branch.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Refer to the xref:circleci-images#[Pre-built CircleCI convenience images] and add `-browsers:` to the image name. This will give you a variant that includes Java 8, geckodriver, Firefox, and Chrome. Add  `-browsers-legacy` to the image name for a variant which includes PhantomJS.

[#selenium]
== Selenium

Many automation tools used for browser tests use Selenium WebDriver, a widely-adopted browser driving standard.

Selenium WebDriver provides a common API for programmatically driving browsers implemented in several popular languages, including Java, Python, and Ruby. Because Selenium WebDriver provides a unified interface for these browsers, you only need to write your browser tests once. These tests will work across all browsers and platforms. See the link:https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#setting-up-a-selenium-webdriver-project[Selenium documentation] for details on setup. Refer to the link:http://www.xfree86.org/4.0.1/Xvfb.1.html[Xvfb man page] for virtual framebuffer X server documentation.

WebDriver can operate in two modes, local, or remote:

* When run locally, your tests use the Selenium WebDriver library to communicate directly with a browser on the same machine.
* When run remotely, your tests interact with a Selenium server, and it is up to the server to drive the browsers.

If Selenium is not included in your primary Docker image, install, and run Selenium as shown below:

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:16.13.1-browsers
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: mkdir test-reports
      - run:
          name: Download Selenium
          command: curl -O http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.5/selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar
      - run:
          name: Start Selenium
          command: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar -log test-reports/selenium.log
          background: true
----

Alternatively, you could move to cloud-based platforms such as LambdaTest, Sauce Labs, or BrowserStack. These cross browser testing clouds provide you with a ready-made infrastructure so you do not have to spend time configuring a Selenium environment.

[#lambdatest]
== LambdaTest

link:https://www.lambdatest.com/[LambdaTest] integrates with CircleCI to boost your go-to-market delivery. Perform automated cross browser testing with LambdaTest. Ensure your development code renders seamlessly through an online Selenium grid providing 2000+ real browsers running through machines, on the cloud. Perform automation testing in parallel with LambdaTest's Selenium grid to drastically trim down your test cycles.

LambdaTest provides an SSH (Secure Shell) tunnel connection, Lambda Tunnel, to help you perform cross browser testing of your locally stored web pages. With Lambda Tunnel, you can see how your website will look to your audience before making it live. Lambda Tunnel executes a test server inside your CircleCI build container to perform automated cross-browser testing on the range of browsers offered by Selenium Grid on LambdaTest.

LambdaTest has developed a link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/lambdatest/lambda-tunnel[CircleCI orb] for browser compatibility testing that enables you to open a Lambda Tunnel before performing any browser testing, easing the process of integrating LambdaTest with CircleCI. Use the orb to quickly set up a Lambda tunnel and the define your test steps.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  lambda-tunnel: lambdatest/lambda-tunnel@0.0.1

jobs:
  lambdatest/with_tunnel:
    tunnel_name: <your-tunnel-name>
    steps:
      - <your-test-steps>

[#sauce-labs]
== Sauce Labs

Sauce Labs has an extensive network of operating system and browser combinations you can test your web application against. Sauce Labs supports automated web app testing using Selenium WebDriver scripts as well as through `saucectl`, their test orchestrator CLI, which can be used to execute tests directly from a variety of JavaScript frameworks.

[#saucectl]
=== `saucectl`

If you are using JavaScript to test your web application, you can still take advantage of the Sauce Labs platform by using link:https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit[`saucectl`] with the JS framework of your choice, and then integrating the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/saucelabs/saucectl-run[saucectl-run orb] in your CircleCI workflow.

. Add your `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as xref:env-vars#[environment variables] in your Circle CI project.
. Modify your CircleCI project `config.yml` to include the saucectl-run orb and then call the orb as a job in your workflow.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  saucectl: saucelabs/saucectl-run@2.0.0

jobs:
  test-cypress:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:lts
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker:
          version: 20.10.2
      - saucectl/saucectl-run

workflows:
  default_workflow:
    jobs:
      - test-cypress
----

[#browserstack-and-appium]
== BrowserStack and Appium

Following the example above, you can replace the installation of Sauce Labs with another cross-browser testing platform, such as BrowserStack. Then, set the `USERNAME` and `ACCESS_KEY` xref:env-vars#[environment variables] to those associated with your BrowserStack account.

For mobile applications, it is possible to use Appium or an equivalent platform that uses the WebDriver protocol. To do this, install Appium in your job, and use CircleCI xref:env-vars#[environment variables] for the `USERNAME` and `ACCESS_KEY`.

[#cypress]
== Cypress

Another browser testing solution you can use in your JavaScript end-to-end testing is link:https://www.cypress.io/[Cypress]. Unlike a Selenium-architected browser testing solution, when using Cypress, you can run tests in the same run-loop as your application.

To simplify this process, use the Cypress orb. You can run all Cypress tests without posting the results to your Cypress dashboard. The example below shows configuration for this scenario:

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1

workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          no-workspace: true
----

For more examples using the Cypress orb, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cypress-io/cypress[Cypress orb] page in the CircleCI orbs registry.

[#debugging-browser-tests]
== Debugging browser tests

Integration tests can be hard to debug, especially when they're running on a remote machine. This section provides some examples of how to debug browser tests on CircleCI.

[#using-screenshots-and-artifacts]
=== Using screenshots and artifacts

CircleCI can be configured to collect xref:artifacts#[build artifacts] and make them available from your build. For example, artifacts enable you to save screenshots as part of your job, and view them when the job finishes. You must explicitly collect those files with the `store_artifacts` step and specify the `path` and `destination`. See the xref:configuration-reference#storeartifacts[`store_artifacts` section] of the configuration reference for an example.

Saving screenshots is supported by most test suites. It is a built-in feature in WebKit and Selenium:

* link:https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot[Automatically on failure, using Cucumber]
* link:https://gist.github.com/michalochman/3175175[Automatically on failure, using Behat and Mink]

[#using-a-local-browser-to-access-http-server-on-circleci]
=== Using a local browser to access HTTP server on CircleCI

If you are running a test that runs an HTTP server on CircleCI, it can be helpful to use a browser running on your local machine to debug a failing test. You can do this with an SSH-enabled run.

. Run an SSH build using the btn:[Rerun Job with SSH] button on the *Job page* of the CircleCI app. The command to log into the container over SSH is as follows:
+
[,shell]
----
ssh -p 64625 ubuntu@54.221.135.43
----

. To add port-forwarding to the command, use the `-L` flag. The following example forwards requests to `+http://localhost:3000+` on your local browser to port `8080` on the CircleCI container. An example use case for this would be if your job runs a debug Ruby on Rails app, which listens on port 8080. After you run this, if you go to your local browser and request `\http://localhost:3000`, you should see whatever is being served on port 8080 of the container.
+
NOTE: Update `8080` to be the port you are running on the CircleCI container.
+
[,shell]
----
ssh -p 64625 ubuntu@54.221.135.43 -L 3000:localhost:8080
----

. Then, open your browser on your local machine and navigate to `+http://localhost:3000+` to send requests directly to the server running on port `8080` on the CircleCI container. You can also manually start the test server on the CircleCI container (if it is not already running), and you should be able to access the running test server from the browser on your development machine.

This is a very easy way to debug things when setting up Selenium tests, for example.

[#interacting-with-the-browser-over-vnc]
=== Interacting with the browser over VNC

VNC allows you to view and interact with the browser that is running your tests. This only works if you are using a driver that runs a real browser. You can interact with a browser that Selenium controls, but PhantomJS is headless, so there is nothing to interact with.

. Install a VNC viewer. If you're using macOS, consider link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/chicken/[Chicken of the VNC].
link:http://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/[RealVNC] is also available on most platforms.
. Open a Terminal window, xref:ssh-access-jobs#[start an SSH run] to a CircleCI container and forward the remote port 5901 to the local port 5902.
+
[,shell]
----
ssh -p PORT ubuntu@IP_ADDRESS -L 5902:localhost:5901
----

. Install the `vnc4server` and `metacity` packages. You can use `metacity` to move the browser around and return to your Terminal window.
+
[,shell]
----
sudo apt install vnc4server metacity
----

. After connecting to the CircleCI container, start the VNC server.
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box159:~$ vncserver -geometry 1280x1024 -depth 24
----

. Since your connection is secured with SSH, there is no need for a strong password. However, you still need _a_ password, so enter `password` at the prompt.
. Start your VNC viewer and connect to `localhost:5902`. Enter your `password` at the prompt.
. You should see a display containing a terminal window. Since your connection is secured through the SSH tunnel, ignore any warnings about an insecure or unencrypted connection.
. To allow windows to open in the VNC server, set the `DISPLAY` variable. Without this command, windows would open in the default (headless) X server.
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box159:~$ export DISPLAY=:1.0
----

. Start `metacity` in the background.
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box159:~$ metacity &
----

. Start `firefox` in the background.
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box159:~$ firefox &
----

Now, you can run integration tests from the command line and watch the browser for unexpected behavior. You can even interact with the browser as if the tests were running on your local machine.

[#sharing-circlecis-x-server]
=== Sharing CircleCI's X Server

If you find yourself setting up a VNC server often, then you might want to automate the process. You can use `x11vnc` to attach a VNC server to X.

. Download link:https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc[`x11vnc`] and start it before your tests:
+
[,yaml]
----
steps:
  - run:
   name: Download and start X
   command: |
     sudo apt-get install -y x11vnc
     x11vnc -forever -nopw
   background: true
----

. Now when you xref:ssh-access-jobs#[start an SSH build], you'll be able to connect to the VNC server while your default test steps run. You can either use a VNC viewer that is capable of SSH tunneling, or set up a tunnel on your own:
+
[,shell]
----
ssh -p PORT ubuntu@IP_ADDRESS -L 5900:localhost:5900
----

[#x11-forwarding-over-ssh]
== X11 forwarding over SSH

NOTE: SSH reruns are not currently supported for GitLab or GitHub App projects. This feature is in development and will be available soon. To find out if you authorized through the GitHub OAuth app or the CircleCI GitHub App, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

CircleCI also supports X11 forwarding over SSH. X11 forwarding is similar to VNC &mdash; you can interact with the browser running on CircleCI from your local machine.

. Install an X Window System on your computer. If you're using macOS, consider link:http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/[XQuartz].
. With X set up on your system, xref:ssh-access-jobs#[start an SSH build] to a CircleCI VM, using the `-X` flag to set up forwarding:
+
[,shell]
----
daniel@mymac$ ssh -X -p PORT ubuntu@IP_ADDRESS
----
+
This will start an SSH session with X11 forwarding enabled.

. To connect your VMs display to your machine, set the display environment variable to `localhost:10.0`
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box10$ export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0
----

. Check that everything is working by starting `xclock`.
+
[,shell]
----
ubuntu@box10$ xclock
----
+
You can kill `xclock` with `Ctrl+c` after it appears on your desktop.

Now you can run your integration tests from the command line and watch the browser for unexpected behavior. You can even interact with the browser as if the tests were running on your local machine.
