CircleCI uses https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/nomad-announcement/[Nomad] as the primary job scheduler. This chapter provides a basic introduction to Nomad for understanding how to operate the Nomad Cluster in your CircleCI installation.

== Basic Terminology and Architecture

- **Nomad Server:** Nomad servers are the brains of the cluster; they receive and allocate jobs to Nomad clients. In CircleCI, a Nomad server runs on your Services machine as a Docker Container.

- **Nomad Client:** Nomad clients execute the jobs they are allocated by Nomad servers. Usually a Nomad client runs on a dedicated machine (often a VM) in order to fully take the advantage of machine power. You can have multiple Nomad clients to form a cluster and the Nomad server allocates jobs to the cluster with its scheduling algorithm.

- **Nomad Jobs:** A Nomad job is a specification, provided by a user, that declares a workload for Nomad. A Nomad job corresponds to an execution of a CircleCI job. If the job uses parallelism, say 10 parallelism, then Nomad will run 10 jobs.

- **Build Agent:** Build Agent is a Go program written by CircleCI that executes steps in a job and reports the results. Build Agent is executed as the main process inside a Nomad Job.

== Basic Operations

The following section is a basic guide to operating a Nomad cluster in your installation.

The `nomad` CLI is installed in the Nomad pod. It is pre-configured to talk to the Nomad cluster, so it is possible to use the `nomad` command to run the following commands in this section.

=== Checking the Jobs Status

The get a list of statuses for all jobs in your cluster, run:

```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad status
```

The `Status` is the most important field in the output, with the following status type definitions:

- `running`: Nomad has started executing the job. This typically means your job in CircleCI is started.

- `pending`: There are not enough resources available to execute the job inside the cluster.

- `dead`: Nomad has finished executing the job. The status becomes `dead` regardless of whether the corresponding CircleCI job/build succeeds or fails.

=== Checking the Cluster Status

To get a list of your Nomad clients, run:

```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad node-status
```

NOTE: `nomad node-status` reports both Nomad clients that are currently serving (status `active`) and Nomad clients that were taken out of the cluster (status `down`). Therefore, you need to count the number of `active` Nomad clients to know the current capacity of your cluster.

To get more information about a specific client, run the following from that client:

```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad node-status -self
```

This will give information such as how many jobs are running on the client and the resource utilization of the client.

=== Checking Logs

As noted in the Nomad Jobs section above, a Nomad Job corresponds to an execution of a CircleCI job. Therefore, Nomad Job logs can sometimes help to understand the status of a CircleCI job if there is a problem. To get logs for a specific job, run:

```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad logs -job -stderr <nomad-job-id>
```

NOTE: Be sure to specify the `-stderr` flag as this is where most Build Agent logs appear.

While the `nomad logs -job` command is useful, the command is not always accurate because the `-job` flag uses a random allocation of the specified job. The term `allocation` is a smaller unit in Nomad Job, which is out of scope for this document. To learn more, please see https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/scheduling.html[the official document].

Complete the following steps to get logs from the allocation of the specified job:

. Get the job ID with `nomad status` command.
. Get the allocation ID of the job with `nomad status <job-id>` command.
. Get the logs from the allocation with `nomad logs -stderr <allocation-id>`

=== Shutting Down a Nomad Client

When you want to shutdown a Nomad client, you must first set the client to `drain` mode. In `drain` mode, the client will finish any jobs that have already been allocated but will not be allocated any new jobs.

. To drain a client, log in to the client and set the client to drain mode with `node-drain` command as follows:
+
```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad node-drain -self -enable
```
. Then, make sure the client is in drain mode using the `node-status` command:
+
```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad node-status -self
```

Alternatively, you can drain a remote node with the following command, substituting the node ID:

```shell
kubectl exec -it nomad-pod-IDm -- nomad node-drain -enable -yes <node-id>
```

=== Scaling Down the Client Cluster

To set up a mechanism for clients to shutdown, first enter `drain` mode, then wait for all jobs to be finished before terminating the client. You can also configure an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html[ASG Lifecycle Hook] that triggers a script for scaling down instances.

The script should use the commands in the section above to do the following:

1. Put the instance in drain mode
2. Monitor running jobs on the instance and wait for them to finish
3. Terminate the instance
