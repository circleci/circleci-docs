Before deploying to Google Cloud Platform, you will need to authorize the Google Cloud SDK and set default configuration settings. Refer to the <<deploy-to-google-cloud-platform#,Authorizing the Google Cloud SDK>> document for full details.

[#using-google-cloud-orbs]
== Using Google Cloud orbs

There are several Google Cloud orbs available in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[CircleCI Orbs Registry] that you can use to simplify your deployments. For example, the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/gcp-gke#usage-publish-and-rollout-image[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) orb] has a pre-built job to build and publish a Docker image, and roll the image out to a GKE cluster, as follows:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  gke: circleci/gcp-gke@x.y.z # Use the GCP GKE orb in your config

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - gke/publish-and-rollout-image:
          cluster: <your-GKE-cluster> # name of GKE cluster to be created
          container: <your-K8-container-name> # name of your Kubernetes container
          deployment: <your-K8-deployment-name> # name of your Kubernetes deployment
          image: <your-image> # name of your Docker image
          tag: $CIRCLE_SHA1 # Docker image tag - optional
```

[#deployment-to-gke-with-2-configuration]
== Deployment to GKE with 2.0 configuration

In the following example, if the `build-job` passes and the current branch is `main`, CircleCI runs the deployment job.

```yml
version: 2

jobs:
  # build job ommitted for brevity
  deploy-job:
    docker:
      - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    working_directory: /tmp/my-project
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Deploy Main to GKE
          command: |
          # Push Docker image to registry, update K8s deployment to use new image - `gcloud` command handles authentication and push all at once
          sudo /opt/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud docker push us.gcr.io/${PROJECT_NAME}/hello
          # The new image is now available in GCR for the GCP infrastructure to access, next, change permissions:
          sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.kube
          # Use `kubectl` to find the line that specifies the image to use for our container, replace with image tag of the new image.
          # The K8s deployment intelligently upgrades the cluster by shutting down old containers and starting up-to-date ones.
          kubectl patch deployment docker-hello-google -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"docker-hello-google","image":"us.gcr.io/circle-ctl-test/hello:'"$CIRCLE_SHA1"'"}]}}}}'

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-job
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - build-job # Only deploy once the build job has completed
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main # Only deploy on the main branch

```
