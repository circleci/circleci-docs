CircleCI Orbs are shareable packages of configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. CircleCI provides certified orbs, along with 3rd-party orbs authored by CircleCI partners. It is best practice to first evaluate whether any of these existing orbs will help you in your configuration workflow. Refer to the [CircleCI Orbs Registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/) for the complete list of available orbs. 

### Importing an Existing Orb

To import an existing orb, add a single line to to your version 2.1 [.circleci/config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) file for each orb, for example:

```
version: 2.1

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@0.1.0
  heroku: circleci/heroku@0.0.1
```

In the above example, two orbs are imported into your config, the [Slack orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/slack) and the [Heroku orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/heroku). 

**Note:** If your project was added to CircleCI prior to 2.1, you must enable [Build Processing]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/build-processing/) to use the `orbs` key.

### Authoring Your Own Orb

If you find that there are no existing orbs that meet your needs, you may author your own orb to meet your specific environment or configuration requirements by using the [CircleCI CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/local-cli/) as shown in the `circleci orb help` output below. Although this is more time-consuming than using the import feature, authoring your own orb enables you to create a world-readable orb for sharing your configuration.

```
$ circleci orb help
Operate on orbs

  circleci orb [command]
