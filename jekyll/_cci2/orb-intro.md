CircleCI Orbs are shareable packages of configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. CircleCI provides certified orbs, along with 3rd-party orbs authored by CircleCI partners. It is best practice to first evaluate whether any of these existing orbs will help you in your configuration workflow. Refer to the [CircleCI Orbs Registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/) for the complete list of certified orbs. 

## Importing an Existing Orb

To import an existing orb, add a single line to to your version 2.1 [.circleci/config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) file for each orb, for example:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@0.1.0
  heroku: circleci/heroku@0.0.1
```

In the above example, two orbs are imported into your config, the [Slack orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/slack) and the [Heroku orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/heroku). 

**Note:** If your project was added to CircleCI prior to 2.1, you must enable "pipelines" to use the `orbs` key.

## Authoring Your Own Orb

If you find that there are no existing orbs that meet your needs, you may author your own orb to meet your specific environment or configuration requirements by using the [CircleCI CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/local-cli/#overview) as shown in the `circleci orb help` output below. Although this is more time-consuming than using the import feature, authoring your own orb enables you to create a world-readable orb for sharing your configuration. See [Creating Orbs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/creating-orbs/) for more information.

```
$ circleci orb help
Operate on orbs

Usage:
  circleci orb [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create an orb in the specified namespace
  list        List orbs
  process     Validate an orb and print its form after all pre-registration processing
  publish     Publish an orb to the registry
  source      Show the source of an orb
  validate    Validate an orb.yml
```

**Note** When authoring an orb, you will agree to CircleCI's Code Sharing Terms of Service when your organization opts-in to 3rd party orb use and authoring. CircleCI thereby licenses all orbs back to users under the MIT License agreement.

## Importing Partner Orbs

Import the following Partner Orbs by using the `orbs` key in your `.circleci.yml/config.yml` file and replacing `<orb reference string>` with one from the table.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  <orb reference string>
```
