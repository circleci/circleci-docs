= Using Docker Authenticated Pulls
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:
:icons: font
:toc: macro
:toc-title:

This document describes how to authenticate with your Docker registry provider to pull images.

Authenticated pulls allow access to private Docker images.  It may also grant higher rate limits depending on your registry provider.

CircleCI has partnered with Docker to ensure that our users can continue to access Docker Hub without rate limits. As of November 1st 2020, with few exceptions, you should not be impacted by any rate limits when pulling images from Docker Hub through CircleCI. However, these rate limits may go into effect for CircleCI users in the future. That’s why we’re encouraging you and your team to add Docker Hub authentication to your CircleCI configuration and consider upgrading your Docker Hub plan, as appropriate, to prevent any impact from rate limits in the future.

## Docker executor
{: #docker-executor }

For the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-docker[Docker executor], specify a username and password in
the `auth` field of your https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference[config.yml] file. To protect the password,
place it in a https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/[context], or use a per-project Environment Variable.

NOTE: Server 2.x customers may instead set up a Docker Hub pull through a xref:docker-hub-pull-through-mirror.adoc[registry mirror].
Pulls through Docker Hub registry mirrors are not yet available on Server 3.x.

NOTE: Contexts are the more flexible option.  CircleCI supports multiple contexts, which is a great way modularize secrets, ensuring jobs can only access what they *need*.

In this example, we grant the "build" job access to Docker credentials context, `docker-hub-creds`, without bloating the existing `build-env-vars` context:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build:
          context:
            - build-env-vars
            - docker-hub-creds

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: acme-private/private-image:321
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user  # can specify string literal values
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # or project environment variable reference
----

You can also use images from a private repository like https://cloud.google.com/container-registry[gcr.io] or
https://quay.io[quay.io]. Make sure to supply the full registry/image URL for the `image` key, and use the appropriate
username/password for the `auth` key. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
- image: quay.io/project/image:tag
  auth:
    username: $QUAY_USERNAME
    password: $QUAY_PASSWORD
----


## Machine executor (with Docker orb)
{: #machine-executor-with-docker-orb }

Alternatively, you can utilize the `machine` executor to achieve the same result using the Docker orb:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
orbs:
  docker: circleci/docker@1.4.0

workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - machine-job:
          context:
            - build-env-vars
            - docker-hub-creds

jobs:
  machine-job:
    machine: true
    steps:
      - docker/check:
          docker-username: DOCKERHUB_LOGIN  # DOCKER_LOGIN is the default value, if it exists, it automatically would be used.
          docker-password: DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # DOCKER_PASSWORD is the default value
      - docker/pull:
          images: 'circleci/node:latest'
----


## Machine executor (with Docker CLI)
{: #machine-executor-with-docker-cli }

or with the CLI:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    working_directory: ~/my_app
    steps:
      # Docker is preinstalled, along with docker-compose
      - checkout

      # start proprietary DB using private Docker image
      - run: |
          docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS
          docker run -d --name db company/proprietary-db:1.2.3
----

## AWS ECR
{: #aws-ecr }

CircleCI now supports pulling private images from Amazon's ECR service.

TIP: You can pull your private images from ECR repositories in any regions. However, for the best experience, we strongly
recommend you make a copy of your image in `us-east-1` region, and specify that `us-east-1` image for the Docker executor.
Our job execution infrastructure is in the `us-east-1` region so using `us-east-1` images speeds up the process of spinning
up your environment.

You can start using private images from ECR in one of two ways:

1. Set your AWS credentials using standard CircleCI private environment variables.
2. Specify your AWS credentials in `.circleci/config.yml` using `aws_auth`:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: account-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/org/repo:0.1
        aws_auth:
          aws_access_key_id: AKIAQWERVA  # can specify string literal values
          aws_secret_access_key: $ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  # or project UI envar reference
----

Both options are virtually the same, however, the second option enables you to specify the variable name you want for the
credentials. This can come in handy where you have different AWS credentials for different infrastructure. For example,
let's say your SaaS app runs the speedier tests and deploys to staging infrastructure on every commit while for Git tag
pushes, we run the full-blown test suite before deploying to production:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: account-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/org/repo:0.1
        aws_auth:
          aws_access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_STAGING
          aws_secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_STAGING
    steps:
      - run:
          name: "Every Day Tests"
          command: "testing...."
      - run:
          name: "Deploy to Staging Infrastructure"
          command: "something something darkside.... cli"
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: account-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/org/repo:0.1
        aws_auth:
          aws_access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_PRODUCTION
          aws_secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_PRODUCTION
    steps:
      - run:
          name: "Full Test Suite"
          command: "testing...."
      - run:
          name: "Deploy to Production Infrastructure"
          command: "something something darkside.... cli"

workflows:
  version: 2
  main:
    jobs:
      - build:
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^\d{4}\.\d+$/
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
            tags:
              only: /^\d{4}\.\d+$/
