[#create-a-kubernetes-cluster]
== 2. Create a Kubernetes cluster
CircleCI server installs into an existing Kubernetes cluster. The application uses a large number of resources. Depending on your usage, your Kubernetes cluster should meet the following requirements:

[.table.table-striped]

Creating a Kubernetes cluster is your responsibility. Please note:

* You must have appropriate permissions to list, create, edit, and delete pods in your cluster. Run this command to verify your permissions:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl auth can-i <list|create|edit|delete> pods
----
* There are no requirements regarding VPC setup or disk size for your cluster. It is recommended that you set up a new VPC rather than use an existing one.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

[#eks]
=== EKS
You can learn more about creating an Amazon EKS cluster https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/[here]. We recommend using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html[`eksctl`] to create your cluster, which creates a VPC and selects the proper security groups for you.

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html[Install] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configure] the AWS CLI for your AWS account.
. Install https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html[`eksctl`].
. Create your cluster by running the following (Cloud formation with `eksctl` and EKS can take more than 20 minutes to complete):
+
[source,shell]
----
eksctl create cluster --name=circleci-server --nodes 4 --node-type m5.xlarge
----
. Once the cluster has been created, you can use the following command to configure `kubectl` access:
+
[source,shell]
----
eksctl utils write-kubeconfig --cluster circleci-server
----

NOTE: You may see the following error `AWS STS Access - cannot get role ARN for current session: InvalidClientTokenID`. This means your AWS credentials are invalid, or your IAM user does not have permission to create an EKS cluster. Proper IAM permissions are necessary to use `eksctl`. See the AWS documentation on https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-permissions/[IAM permissions].

endif::env-gcp[]

ifndef::env-aws[]

[#gke]
=== GKE
You can learn more about creating a GKE cluster https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to#creating-clusters[here].

CAUTION: Do not use Autopilot cluster. CircleCI requires functionality that is not supported by GKE Autopilot.

. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud[Install] and https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#defaults[configure] the GCP CLI for your GCP account. This includes creating a Google Project, which will be required to create a cluster within your project. 
+
NOTE: When you create your project, make sure you also enable API access. If you do not enable API access, the command we will run next (to create your cluster) will fail.
+
Setting the default `project id`, compute `zone` and `region` will make running subsequent commands easier:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
gcloud config set compute/zone <ZONE>
gcloud config set compute/region <REGION>
----
. Create your cluster 
+
TIP: CircleCI recommends using https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Workload Identity] to allow workloads/pods in your GKE clusters to impersonate Identity and Access Management (IAM) service accounts to access Google Cloud services. Use the following command to provision a simple cluster:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud container clusters create circleci-server \
  --num-nodes 3 \
  --machine-type n1-standard-4 \
  --workload-pool=<PROJECT_ID>.svc.id.goog
----
+
NOTE: Your kube-context should get updated with the new cluster credentials automatically.
+
If you need to update your kube-context manually, you can by running the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud container clusters get-credentials circleci-server
----
. Install the https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke[GKE authentication plugin] for `kubectl`:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
----
. Verify your cluster:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl cluster-info
----
. Create a service account:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts create <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID> --description="<DESCRIPTION>" \
  --display-name="<DISPLAY_NAME>"
----
. Retrieve credentials for the service account:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create <KEY_FILE> \
  --iam-account <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
----
endif::env-aws[]

[#enable-workload-identity-in-gke]
==== Enable Workload Identity in GKE (optional)
Follow these steps if you already have a GKE cluster and need to enable Workload Identity on the cluster and the node pools.

. Enable Workload Identity on existing cluster:
+
[source,shell]
----
  gcloud container clusters update "<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
    --workload-pool="<PROJECT_ID>.svc.id.goog"
----
. Get node pools of existing GKE cluster:
+
[source,shell]
----
  gcloud container node-pools list --cluster "<CLUSTER_NAME>"
----

. Update existing node pools:
+
[source,shell]
----
  gcloud container node-pools update "<NODEPOOL_NAME>" \
    --cluster="<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
    --workload-metadata="GKE_METADATA"
----

You must repeat Step 3 for all the existing node pools. Follow these links for steps to enable Workload Identity for your Kubernetes service accounts: 

* link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/installation/phase-3-execution-environments/#nomad-autoscaler-gcp[Nomad Autoscaler]
* link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/installation/phase-3-execution-environments/#gcp-3[VM]

[#create-a-new-github-oauth-app]
== 3. Create a new GitHub OAuth app

CAUTION: If GitHub Enterprise and CircleCI server are not on the same domain, then images and icons from GHE will fail to load in the CircleCI web app.

Registering and setting up a new GitHub OAuth app for CircleCI server allows for authorization control to your server installation using GitHub OAuth and for updates to GitHub projects/repos using build status information. THe following steps apply for both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise.

. In your browser, navigate to **your GitHub instance** > **User Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **OAuth Apps** and click the **New OAuth App** button.
+
.New GitHub OAuth App
image::github-oauth-new.png[Screenshot showing setting up a new OAuth app]

. Complete the following fields, based on your planned installation:
** *Homepage URL*: The URL of your planned CircleCI installation.
** *Authorization callback URL*: The authorization callback URL is the URL of your planned CircleCI installation followed by `/auth/github`

. Once completed, you will be shown the *Client ID*. Select *Generate a new Client Secret* to generate a Client Secret for your new OAuth App. You will need these values when you configure CircleCI server.
+
.Client ID and Secret
image::github-clientid.png[Screenshot showing GitHub Client ID]

[#github-enterprise]
=== GitHub Enterprise

If using GitHub Enterprise, you also need a personal access token and the domain name of your GitHub Enterprise instance.

Create the `defaultToken` by navigating to **User Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens**. The default token requires no scopes. You will need this value when you configure CircleCI server.

[#frontend-tls-certificates]
== 4. Frontend TLS certificates
By default, CircleCI server creates self-signed certificates to get you started. In production, you should supply a certificate from a trusted certificate authority. The link:https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] certificate authority, for example, can issue a free certificate using their link:https://certbot.eff.org/[certbot] tool. The sections below cover using Google Cloud DNS and AWS Route 53.

CAUTION: It is important that your certificate contains both your domain and the `app.*` subdomain as subjects. For example, if you host your installation at `server.example.com`, your certificate must cover `app.server.example.com` and `server.example.com`.

Once you have created your certificates using one of the methods described below, you can use the following commands to retrieve the certificates later when you need them during this installation:

[source,shell]
----
ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>
----

[source,shell]
----
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem
----

[source,shell]
----
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem
----

ifndef::env-gcp[]

[#aws-route-53]
=== AWS Route 53

. If you are using AWS Route 53 for DNS, you need the *certbot-route53* plugin installed. You can install the plugin with the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
python3 -m pip install certbot-dns-route53
----

. Then execute this example to create a private key and certificate (including intermediate certificates) locally in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>`:
+
[source,shell]
----
certbot certonly --dns-route53 -d "<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>" -d "app.<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>"
----

endif::env-gcp[]

ifndef::env-aws[]

[#google-cloud-dns]
=== Google Cloud DNS

. If you host your DNS on Google Cloud, you need the *certbot-dns-google* plugin installed. You can install the plugin with the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
python3 -m pip install certbot-dns-google
----
. The service account used to run `certbot` will need to have access to Cloud DNS in order to provision the necessary records used by Let's Encrypt for domain validation.
.. Create a custom role for certbot:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam roles create certbot --project=<PROJECT_ID> \
    --title="<TITLE>" --description="<DESCRIPTION>" \
    --permissions="dns.changes.create,dns.changes.get,dns.changes.list,dns.managedZones.get,dns.managedZones.list,dns.resourceRecordSets.create,dns.resourceRecordSets.delete,dns.resourceRecordSets.list,dns.resourceRecordSets.update" \
    --stage=ALPHA
----
.. Bind the new role to the service account which we created earlier:
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
    --member="serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="<ROLE_NAME>"
----
. Finally, the following commands will provision a certification for your installation:
+
[source,shell]
----
certbot certonly --dns-google --dns-google-credentials <KEY_FILE> -d "<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>" -d "app.<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>"
----

endif::env-aws[]

[#encryption-signing-keys]
== 5. Encryption/signing keys
The keysets generated in this section are used to encrypt and sign artifacts generated by CircleCI. You will need these values to configure server.

CAUTION: Store these values securely. If they are lost, job history and artifacts will not be recoverable.

[#artifact-signing-key]
=== Artifact signing key
To generate an artifact signing key, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker run circleci/server-keysets:latest generate signing -a stdout
----

[#encryption-signing-key]
=== Encryption signing key
To generate an encryption signing key, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker run circleci/server-keysets:latest generate encryption -a stdout
----

[#object-storage-and-permissions]
== 6. Object storage and permissions
Server v4.x hosts build artifacts, test results, and other state object storage. The following storage options are supported:

* link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[AWS S3]

* link:https://min.io/[MinIO]

* link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage]

While any S3 compatible object storage may work, we test and support AWS S3 and MinIO. For object storage providers that do not support the S3 API, such as Azure blob storage, we recommend using MinIO Gateway.

Follow the instructions below to create a bucket and access method for S3 or GCS.

NOTE: If you are installing behind a proxy, object storage should be behind this proxy also. Otherwise, proxy details will need to be supplied at the job level within every project `.circleci/config.yml` to allow artifacts, test results, cache save and restore, and workspaces to work. For more information see the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/operator/installing-server-behind-a-proxy/[Installing Server Behind a Proxy] guide.

[#set-up-authentication]
==== Set up authentication

There are two ways to authenticate CircleCI with S3: IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), and IAM access keys. IRSA is the recommended method.

[#irsa]
===== IRSA

The following is a summary of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[AWS's Documentation on IRSA] that is sufficient for installing CircleCI.

. Attach policy to user.

[source,shell]
----
aws iam put-user-policy \
  --user-name circleci-server \
  --policy-name circleci-server \
  --policy-document file://policy.json
----

. Create Access Key for user circleci-server.
+
NOTE: You will need this when you configure your server installation later.
+
[source,shell]
----
aws iam create-access-key --user-name circleci-server
----
+
The result should look like this:

[source, json]
----
{
  "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "circleci-server",
        "Status": "Active",

[#create-a-gcp-bucket]
==== Create a GCP bucket
If your server installation runs in a GKE cluster, ensure that your current IAM user is cluster admin for this cluster, as RBAC (role-based access control) objects need to be created. More information can be found in the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control[GKE documentation].

[source,shell]
----
gsutil mb gs://circleci-server-bucket
----

[#set-up-authentication]
==== Set up authentication
The recommended method for workload/pod authentication is to use https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Workload Identity]. However, you may also use static credentials (json key file).

. Create a Service Account.
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts create circleci-storage --description="Service account for CircleCI object storage" --display-name="circleci-storage"
----

. Bind the `objectAdmin` role to the service account.
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
    --member="serviceAccount:circleci-storage@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin" \
    --condition='expression=resource.name.startsWith("projects/_/buckets/circleci-server-bucket"),title=restrict_bucket'
----

. Either enable Workload Identity or use static credentials.
** When using Workload Identity you need to configure your account such that the workloads/pods can access the storage bucket from the cluster using the Kubernetes service account `"<K8S_NAMESPACE>/object-storage"`.
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding circleci-storage@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
    --member "serviceAccount:<PROJECT_ID>.svc.id.goog[<K8S_NAMESPACE>/object-storage]"
----
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
    --member serviceAccount:circleci-storage@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator \
    --condition=None
----

** If you are not using Workload Identity, create a json file containing static credentials.
+
[source,shell]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create <KEY_FILE> \
    --iam-account circleci-storage@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
