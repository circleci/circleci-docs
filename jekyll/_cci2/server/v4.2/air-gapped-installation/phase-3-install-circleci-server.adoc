= Phase 3 - Install CircleCI server
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:
:page-description: How to install the CircleCI server Helm deployment to an air-gapped environment.
:icons: font
:toc: macro
:toc-title:

With prerequisites installed, and object storage configured, you can now copy over and install the CircleCI Helm deployment to the Kubernetes cluster in your air-gapped environment.

[#prepare-values-yaml]
== 1. Prepare values.yaml
The `values.yaml` file for installing CircleCI should be prepared according to the xref:../installation/phase-2-core-services/#create-helm-values[Create Helm values] section of the regular installation guide. Once this is complete, you will modify the fields listed in the steps below for air-gapped installation compatibility.

=== a. Configure global values

NOTE: For a full example of a `values.yaml` file for an air-gapped environment, see the xref:example-values[Example `values.yaml`] page.

In the `global.container` section of your `values.yaml` file:

* Set the `domainName` value to the internal domain name of the installation
* Set `container.org` to `circleci`
* Set `container.registry` to the internal registry hostname (and port if using a non-standard port) of your instance

[source, yaml]
----
global:
  ...
  domainName: "server.internal.example.com"
  container:
    registry: "docker.internal.example.com:5000"
    org: "<image-registry-org>"
----

NOTE: If you are using a non-TLS installation for your docker registry, visit the xref:additional-considerations#non-tls-docker-registry-installations[Non-TLS Docker Installation] section for consideration.

=== b. Configure GitHub Enterprise
In the `github` section of your `values.yaml` file, configure settings for your GitHub Enterprise installation.

The `hostname` value should be the internal hostname of your GitHub enterprise installation. The `enterprise` value should be set to true.

If this instance is not using TLS or self-signed certificates, make sure to set the `unsafeDisableWebhookSSLVerification: true` and `selfSignedCert: true` values.

Additionally, an OAuth application and a personal access token should be set in GitHub Enterprise and values provided as shown below. For more information about this process, see the documentation for creating a xref:../installation/phase-1-prerequisites/#create-a-new-github-oauth-app[GitHub OAuth application].

[source, yaml]
----
# GitHub Enterprise
github:
  hostname: "github.internal.example.com"
  unsafeDisableWebhookSSLVerification: true # If using self-signed certificates
  enterprise: true
  selfSignedCert: true # If using self-signed certificates
  # These must be generated and added manually from GitHub Enterprise
  clientId: "<<github-enterprise-oauth-app-client-id>>"
  clientSecret: "<<github-enterprise-oauth-app-client-secret>>"
  defaultToken: "<<github-enterprise-personal-application-token>>"
----

[#configure-minio-storage]
=== c. Configure MinIO Object Storage
In the `object_storage` section of the `values.yaml` file, add the following configuration, modifying ports as necessary.

[source, yaml]
----
object_storage:
  bucketName: circleci-data
  expireAfter: 0
  s3:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: http://<minio-internal-hostname>:9000
    accessKey: <minio-root-user>
    secretKey: <minio-root-password>
----

NOTE: Update the endpoint protocol to `http` or `https` depending on your MinIO installation.


=== d. Configure MinIO Build Agent
In the distributor section of the `values.yaml` file, point `agent_base_url` and `launch_agent_base_url` to the `circleci-data` bucket you created in your MinIO installation.

[source, yaml]
----
distributor:
  agent_base_url: http://<minio-internal-hostname>:9000/circleci-data/
  launch_agent_base_url: http://<minio-internal-hostname>:9000/circleci-data/
----

NOTE: Port 9000 is referenced here as that is a default for MinIO. If your MinIO instance is configured differently, this port will need to be updated.

NOTE: Update the protocol to `http` or `https` depending on your MinIO installation.


[#configure-build-agent-image]
=== e. Configure the Nomad build agent image
Specify the location of the Nomad build agent image within your registry, copied during phase 1, modifying the port as necessary.

[source, yaml]
----
nomad:
  ...
  buildAgentImage: "<your-internal-registry-hostname>:5000/circleci/picard"
----

NOTE: Update the port on your Docker registry hostname as necessary

NOTE: If using a non-tls installation for your docker registry, visit the xref:additional-considerations#non-tls-docker-registry-installations[Non-TLS Docker Installation] section for consideration.


[#configure-vm-service]
=== f. Disable VM Service
In the `vm_service` section of `values.yaml`, set `enabled` to `false` to disable it. This feature requires cloud connectivity.

[source, yaml]
----
# VM Service Disabled - Requires cloud connectivity
vm_service:
  enabled: false
----

[#add-additional-nginx-annotations]
=== g. Add Additional nginx Annotations
Add any additional nginx annotations as necessary depending on your installation to provision a load balancer. In this example, MetalLB is used. For more information, see the xref:additional-considerations/#service-type-load-balancers-k3s[Service Type Load Balancers in K3s] section on the Additional considerations page.

[source, yaml]
----
# Additional nginx annotations
nginx:
  annotations:
    # This example uses MetalLB as a k3s load balancer
    metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip: default
----

[#install-circleci-server-helm-airgap]
== 2. Install CircleCI server

With your completed `values.yaml` file and the copied Helm chart, run the Helm install command in your air-gapped environment to install CircleCI server.

We recommend first creating a namespace (`circleci-server`) and deploying the chart into that namespace.

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
helm install circleci-server ./circleci-server/ -n <kubernetes-namespace> --version {serverversion42} -f <path-to-values.yaml>
----

[#post-install-circleci-server-helm-airgap]
== 3. Post Installation Steps
After the Helm deployment, depending on your installation, it may be necessary to manually patch the circleci-proxy Load Balancer service (such as when using MetalLB). For more information, see the xref:additional-considerations/#service-type-load-balancers-k3s[Service Type Load Balancers in K3s] section on the Additional considerations page.

[#next-steps]
== Next steps

Once the steps on this page are complete, go to the xref:phase-4-configure-nomad-clients#[Phase 4 - Configure Nomad clients] guide.
