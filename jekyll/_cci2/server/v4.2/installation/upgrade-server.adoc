This page describes the steps needed to upgrade your CircleCI server v4.2 installation.

A successful deployment will update the web app. Unless noted in the release notes, updates are rolling updates and there is no downtime.

NOTE: We recommend that you do not skip releases when upgrading.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Ensure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster in which server is installed.
* Ensure you have set up xref:../operator/backup-and-restore#[Backup and Restore].
* Ensure there is a recent backup. For more information, see the xref:../opertor/backup-and-restore#creating-backups[Backup and Restore] guide.
* If you are upgrading from Server v4.1.x to Server v4.2.0, and have chosen to manage secrets yourself, follow the <<user-managed-secrets-migration>> step before upgrading.

[#user-managed-secrets-migration]
== User-managed secrets migration 4.1.x-4.2.0

From server v4.2, CircleCI server auto-generates the following secrets if not present in the Kubernetes namespace:

- xref:../installation/phase-2-core-services#api-token[api-token]
- xref:../installation/phase-2-core-services#session-cookie[session-cookie]
- xref:../installation/phase-2-core-services#pusher-kubernetes-secret[pusher]
- xref:../installation/phase-3-execution-environments#nomad-gossip-encryption-key[nomad-gossip-encryption-key]

**Before upgrading to Server 4.2**: If you manage the secrets listed above yourself, run the following command for **each secret** to let CircleCI server know that they already exist.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> annotate secret/<secret-name> \
  meta.helm.sh/release-name=<helm-release-name> \
  meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=<namespace> \
  helm.sh/resource-policy=keep --overwrite

kubectl -n <namespace> label secret/<secret-name> \
  app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm --overwrite
