:page-description: Learn about CircleCI server v4.5 semantic versioning and release schedules.
:icons: font
:toc: macro
:toc-title:

CircleCI is committed to supporting four minor versions of the software. This means a minor version will receive patches for up to 12 months. We use semantic versioning to help identify releases and their impact on your installation.

[#semantic-versioning]
== Semantic versioning
Given a version number, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH increment, use the:

. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

[#release-schedule]
== Release schedule
We release monthly patch fixes for bugs and security concerns. We will have quarterly new feature releases. All releases will be posted to the change log. To stay up to date with the most recent releases, subscribe to the link:https://circleci.com/server/changelog/[change log].

[#end-of-support]
== End of support
With each minor release, in accordance with our link:https://circleci.com/legal/terms-of-service/[terms of service], we end support for previous versions of server. The following table provides dates for previously released versions.

CAUTION: Future dates listed here may change at any time.
