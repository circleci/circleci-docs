MongoDB is a database service used by CircleCI server. This page describes how to upgrade MongoDB to version `4.4.15`.

MongoDB `3.6.22` is shipped with CircleCI server v4.5.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Ensure backups have been taken. You will need a backup of MongoDB to restore to in case anything goes wrong during the upgrade progress
* You are prepared to modify the `values.yaml`
* `helm upgrade` will work from your system to upgrade the cluster
* MongoDB root password is available

[#script-upgrade]
== Scripted upgrade
We have created a shell script which may be used to upgrade your cluster's MongoDB instance link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-scripts/tree/main/upgrade-mongo-to-4.4[here].
If you wish, you may use the following instructions to manually upgrade your cluster's MongoDB

[#manual-upgrade]
== Manual upgrade

=== 1. Upgrade from MongoDB 3.6 to 4.0

. Your `values.yaml` should contain the following snippet:
+
```yaml
mongodb:
  image:
    tag: 3.6.22-debian-9-r38
```
+
To begin the upgrade process, change the tag to `4.0.27-debian-9-r118`:
+
```yaml
mongodb:
  image:
    tag: 4.0.27-debian-9-r118
```

. Run `helm upgrade` to update your installation.

. Once the `helm upgrade` has completed and MongoDB has rolled, you will need to `exec` into the pod (with the root password handy) to modify the compatibility version. (Be sure to replace `<password>` with your MongoDB root password.)
+
```bash
kubectl exec -it mongodb-0 -- mongo -u root -p <password>
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )
```

. You should get a `{ "ok" : 1 }` response from Mongo. Exit out of the MongoDB shell and pod.

=== 2. Upgrade from MongoDB 4.0 to 4.2

. Change the tag to `4.2.17-debian-10-r99`:
+
```yaml
mongodb:
  image:
    tag: 4.2.17-debian-10-r99
```

. Run `helm upgrade` to update your installation.

. Once the `helm upgrade` has completed and MongoDB has rolled, you will need to `exec` into the pod (with the root password handy) to modify the compatibility version. (Be sure to replace `<password>` with your MongoDB root password.)
+
```bash
kubectl exec -it mongodb-0 -- mongo -u root -p <password>
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.2" } )
```

. You should get `{ "ok" : 1 }` again. Exit out of the shell and pod.

=== 3. Upgrade from MongoDB 4.2 to 4.4

. Change the tag one more time to `4.4.15-debian-10-r8`:
+
```yaml
mongodb:
  image:
    tag: 4.4.15-debian-10-r8
```

. Run `helm upgrade` to update your installation.

. Once the `helm upgrade` has completed and MongoDB has rolled, you will need to `exec` into the pod (with the root password handy) to modify the compatibility version. (Be sure to replace `<password>` with your MongoDB root password.)
+
```bash
kubectl exec -it mongodb-0 -- mongo -u root -p <password>
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )
```

. Once you receive `{ "ok" : 1 }`, you have successfully upgraded your MongoDB to 4.4.15.
