// This doc uses ifdef and ifndef directives to display or hide content specific to Google Cloud Storage (env-gcp) and AWS (env-aws). Currently, this affects only the generated PDFs. To ensure compatability with the Jekyll version, the directives test for logical opposites. For example, if the attribute is NOT env-aws, display this content. For more information, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/.

Before you begin with the CircleCI server v4.4 post installation phase, ensure you have run through xref:phase-1-prerequisites#[Phase 1 – Prerequisites], xref:phase-2-core-services#[Phase 2 - Core Services Installation] and xref:phase-3-execution-environments#[Phase 3 - Execution Environments Installation].

NOTE: In the following sections, replace any sections indicated by `< >` with your details.

[#backup-and-restore]
== Backup and restore

[#managing-orbs]
== Managing orbs

CircleCI server installations include their own local orb registry. This registry is private to the server installation. All orbs referenced in project configs reference the orbs in the _server_ orb registry. You are responsible for maintaining orbs. This includes:

* Copying orbs from the public registry.
* Updating orbs that may have been copied previously.
* Registering your company's private orbs, if you have any.

For more information and steps to complete these tasks, see the xref:../operator/managing-orbs#[Orbs on server guide].
