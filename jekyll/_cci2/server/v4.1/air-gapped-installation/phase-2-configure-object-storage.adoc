:page-description: How to configure object storage through MinIO to run CircleCI server v4.1 in an air-gapped environment.
:icons: font
:experimental:

[#create-buckets-in-minio]
== 1. Create buckets in MinIO
CircleCI server supports link:https://min.io/[MinIO] for air-gapped object storage. MinIO is used in the air-gapped environment as a replacement for cloud-based object storage, such as GCP GCS or AWS S3. With an air-gapped MinIO instance installed, complete the steps outlined in the next sections.

[#create-circleci-data-bucket]
=== a. Create a `circleci-data` bucket.
Create a new bucket in MinIO named `circleci-data`.

NOTE: This bucket can be given a different name, but references to it will need to be updated in the Helm `values.yaml` file.

[#configure-circleci-data-bucket]
=== b. Configure the `circleci-data` bucket.
In the settings for the `circleci-data` bucket, change the access policy to `public`.

[#copy-circleci-build-agent]
== 2. Copy the CircleCI build agent
Follow the steps in this section to copy the pinned CircleCI build agent into MinIO within your air-gapped environment.

[#retrieve-pinned-agent-version]
=== a. Extract the pinned agent version from the Helm chart
Fetch the `circleci-server` Helm chart and extract the pinned agent version from it. Set this to the environment variable `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION` so that it can be referenced in later steps.

[source, bash]
----
# Fetch the Helm chart for inspection. Replace `<version>` with the full version of CircleCI server.
helm fetch oci://cciserver.azurecr.io/circleci-server --version <version> --untar

# Set `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION` to the value of `circleci/picard` in `images.yaml`.
export CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION=$(grep 'circleci/picard:' ./circleci-server/images.yaml | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Verify `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION` is set. The value should be similar in form to `1.0.217358-0b5336a7`.
echo $CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION
----

[#copy-release-txt]
=== b. Create a release.txt file and copy to MinIO
Create a `release.txt` file with the value of `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION`. Copy this file to your air-gapped environment and place it in the root of the `circleci-data` bucket in MinIO.

[#retrieve-pinned-agent-bin]
=== c. Retrieve the pinned agent binary
Retrieve and download the pinned `circleci-agent` release and checksums from the CircleCI binary releases public bucket.

[source, bash]
----
# Download circleci-agent
curl -O --compressed https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION/linux/amd64/circleci-agent

# Download checksums
curl -O https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION/checksums.txt
----

[#create-release-dir]
=== d. Create a release directory in the `circleci-data` bucket
Using the version specified by `release.txt`, create a new directory in the root of the `circleci-data` bucket with the name of that release. In the following examples, a directory is created at the root of `circleci-data` in MinIO with the name `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION`. Note `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION` is not a literal string, but the value of the environment variable we set earlier.

[#upload-checksums-file]
=== e. Upload the checksums.txt file to the newly created directory.
Copy the downloaded `checksums.txt` file (step c) to your virtual environment, and place it in MinIO nested under the newly created release directory (step d).

[source,shell]
----
# The structure of the directory should now look like this.
# Note `$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION` is not a literal string, but the value of the environment variable we set earlier.
$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION/
└── checksums.txt
----

[#create-new-subdirs]
=== f. Create two new subdirectories in the release directory
Within the release directory (step d), create two new nested subdirectories, first `linux`, and then within it, `amd64`.

[source,shell]
----
# The structure of the directory of the bucket should look like this:
$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION/
├── checksums.txt
└── linux/
    └── amd64/
----

image::./minio/minio_create_amd_dir.png[Creating an AMD dir]

[#copy-build-agent-bin]
=== g. Copy the downloaded `circleci-agent` file
Copy the downloaded `circleci-agent` file (step c) to your virtual environment, and place it in the amd64 directory you just created.

[source,shell]
----
# The final structure of the bucket should look similar to this:
$CIRCLE_AGENT_VERSION/
├── checksums.txt
└── linux/
    └── amd64/
        └── circleci-agent
