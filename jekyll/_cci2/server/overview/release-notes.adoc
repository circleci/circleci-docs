Server v4.0 offers the following:

* Greatly improved security handling, installation, and update processes.
* Installed using Helm charts and images that can be pulled ahead of time to comply with your security processes.
* Installation processes can use artifacts pulled from customer-managed registries.
* Improved use of Kubernetes secrets and removes the requirement to grant permissions and network access to third-party tools.
