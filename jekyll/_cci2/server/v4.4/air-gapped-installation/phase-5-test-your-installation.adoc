:toc-title:

Test your air-gapped installation using CircleCI's Reality Check project.

[#copy-reality-check]
== 1. Copy CircleCI server Reality Check
Copy the link:https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck[CircleCI server Reality Check repository] to your GitHub Enterprise installation in your air-gapped environment.

[#setup-reality-check]
== 2. Set up CircleCI server Reality Check
Set up CircleCI server Reality Check using the link:https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck#installation[instructions in the readme].

CAUTION: Make sure to set the `CIRCLE_CLOUD_PROVIDER` environment variable to `other`.

[#modify-reality-check]
== 3. Modify Reality Check source code
Replace any references to Docker images in `.circleci/config.yml` with your internal Docker registry.

For example, in your GitHub Enterprise instance, change the following:

[source, yaml]
----
  ...
  artifacts_test_results:
    docker:
      - image: python:3.6.0
----


[source, yaml]
----
  ...
  artifacts_test_results:
    docker:
      - image: <your-internal-registry-hostname-and-port>/python:3.6.0
----

NOTE: Leave image values nested under "machine" as is. Only modify Docker image values.


[#run-reality-check]
== 4. Run Reality Check
Run Reality Check by pushing a commit to it in your GitHub Enterprise installation.

NOTE: the `aws_jobs` and `gcp_jobs` workflows will be cancelled automatically due to the `CIRCLE_CLOUD_PROVIDER` environment variable being set to `other`.
