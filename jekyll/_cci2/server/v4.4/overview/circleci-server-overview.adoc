[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI server is an on-premises CI/CD platform for enterprise customers who have compliance or security needs that require them to operate within their firewall, in a private cloud, or in a data center.

CircleCI server provides the same features as CircleCIâ€™s cloud offering, but operates within your Kubernetes cluster.

[#architecture]
== Architecture

The following diagram presents and overview of the services architecture of CircleCI server.

[#ports-and-services]
=== Ports and services

The CircleCI server application exposes two services, `nginx` and `nomad-server`, using a single load balancer. If required, the load balancer can be made private, separating it from the public internet.

[#job-scheduling-and-artifact-storage]
=== Job scheduling and artifact storage

CircleCI server schedules CI jobs using HashiCorp link:https://www.nomadproject.io/[Nomad]. Depending on the execution environment used for a job, the resources are provisioned through one of the following:

* Nomad for the Docker executor
* Machine provisioner for virtual machines (VMs), the `machine` executor
* Runner, if used, for all executor types

The Nomad control plane runs inside your Kubernetes cluster. Nomad clients, which are responsible for running scheduled CircleCI jobs, are provisioned outside the cluster.

CircleCI server can run Docker jobs on the Nomad clients themselves or in a dedicated virtual machine (VM).

For more information on Nomad architecture and use, see the xref:../operator/introduction-to-nomad-cluster-operation#[Introduction to Nomad Cluster operation].

Job artifacts and outputs are sent directly from jobs in Nomad to object storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other supported options). Audit logs and other items from the application are also stored in object storage, so both the Kubernetes cluster and the Nomad clients need access to object storage.

[#list-of-services-and-their-function]
== List of services and their function

CircleCI server v4.4 consists of the following services. Find their descriptions and failure implications below:

| App Core
| Persists audit log events to blob storage for long-term storage.
| Some events may not be recorded.
|

| A failed cache can result in rate limiting from the VCS if too many calls are made to it.
|

| `circleci-telegraf`
|
| Telegraf collects statsd metrics. All white-boxed metrics in our services publish statsd metrics that are sent to Telegraf,
but can also be configured to be exported to other places (such as Datadog or Prometheus).
|
|

| `circleci-vault`
|
| HashiCorp Vault to run encryption and decryption as a service for secrets.
|
|

| `contexts-service`

|
|

| `domain-service`
| App Core
| Stores and provides information about our domain model. Works with permissions and API.

|

| `execution-gateway-*`
| Execution
| Boundary for execution to provide API to rest of CircleCI
|

[#supported-platforms]
== Supported platforms

CircleCI server is designed to deploy within a Kubernetes cluster. The machine service (machine provisioner) is able to leverage unique EKS or GKE offerings to dynamically create VM images.

If installing outside of EKS or GKE, additional work is required to access some of the same machine build features. Setting up CircleCI runner gives you access to the same feature set as machine provisioner across a much wider range of operating systems and machine types (for example, macOS).

We do our best to support a wide range of platforms for installation. We use environment-agnostic solutions wherever possible. However, we do not test all platforms and options. For that reason, we provide a list of tested environments, which we will continue to expand.
