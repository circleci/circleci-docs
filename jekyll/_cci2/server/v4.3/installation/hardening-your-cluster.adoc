This section provides supplemental information on hardening your Kubernetes cluster.

[#network-topology]
== Network topology
A server installation basically runs three different type of compute instances: The Kubernetes nodes, Nomad clients, and external VMs.

Best practice is to make as many of the resources as private as possible. If your users will access your CircleCI server installation via VPN, there is no need to assign any public IP addresses at all, as long as you have a working NAT gateway setup. Otherwise, you will need at least one public subnet for the `circleci-proxy` load balancer.

However, in this case, it is also recommended to place Nomad clients and VMs in a public subnet to enable your users to SSH into jobs and scope access via networking rules.

NOTE: An nginx reverse proxy is placed in front of link:https://github.com/Kong/charts[Kong] and exposed as a Kubernetes service named `circleci-proxy`. nginx is responsible routing the traffic to the following services: `kong` and `nomad`.

CAUTION: When using Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM), the name of the nginx service will be `circleci-proxy-acm` instead of `circleci-proxy`. If you have switched from some other method of handling your TLS certificates to using ACM, this change will recreate the load balancer and you will have to reroute your associated DNS records for your `<domain>` and `app.<domain>`.

[#network-traffic]
== Network traffic
This section explains the minimum requirements for a server installation to work. Depending on your workloads, you might need to add additional rules to egress for Nomad clients and VMs. As nomenclature between cloud providers differs, you will probably need to implement these rules using firewall rules and/or security groups.

Where you see "external," this usually means all external IPv4 addresses. Depending on your particular setup, you might be able to be more specific (for example, if you are using a proxy for all external traffic).

The rules explained here are assumed to be stateful and for TCP connections only, unless stated otherwise. If you are working with stateless rules, you need to create matching ingress or egress rules for the ones listed here.

[#reverse-proxy-status]
=== Reverse proxy status
You may wish to check the status of the services routing traffic in your CircleCI server installation and alert if there are any issues. Since we use both nginx and Kong in CircleCI server, we expose the status pages of both via port 80.

[#kubernetes-load-balancers]
## Kubernetes load balancers
Depending on your setup, your load balancers might be transparent (that is, they are not treated as a distinct layer in your networking topology). In this case, you can apply the rules from this section directly to the underlying destination or source of the network traffic. Refer to the documentation of your cloud provider to make sure you understand how to correctly apply networking security rules, given the type of load balancing you are using with your installation.

[#ingress-load-balancers]
=== Ingress
If the traffic rules for your load balancers have not been created automatically, here are their respective ports:

| Nomad clients
| Communication with Nomad clients

| `circleci-proxy/-acm`
| 8585
| Nomad clients

|===

[#egress-load-balancers]
=== Egress
The only type of egress needed is TCP traffic to the Kubernetes nodes on the Kubernetes load balancer ports (30000-32767). This is not needed if your load balancers are transparent.

[#common-rules-for-compute-instances]
== Common rules for compute instances
These rules apply to all compute instances, but not to the load balancers.

[#ingress-common]
=== Ingress
If you want to access your instances using SSH, you will need to open port 22 for TCP connections for the instances in question.
It is recommended to scope the rule as closely as possible to allowed source IP addresses and/or only add such a rule when needed.

[#egress-common]
=== Egress
You most likely want all of your instances to access internet resources. This requires you to allow egress for UDP and TCP on port 53 to the DNS server within your VPC, as well as TCP ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, respectively.
Instances building jobs (that is, the Nomad clients and external VMs) also will likely need to pull code from your VCS using SSH (TCP port 22). SSH is also used to communicate with external VMs, so it should be allowed for all instances with the destination of the VM subnet and your VCS, at the very least.

[#kubernetes-nodes]
== Kubernetes nodes

[#intra-node-traffic]
=== Intra-node traffic
By default, the traffic within your Kubernetes cluster is regulated by networking policies. For most purposes, this should be sufficient to regulate the traffic between pods and there is no additional requirement to reduce traffic between Kubernetes nodes any further (it is fine to allow all traffic between Kubernetes nodes).

To make use of networking policies within your cluster, you may need to take additional steps, depending on your cloud provider and setup. Here are some resources to get you started:

* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[Kubernetes Network Policy Overview]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/network-policy[Creating a Cluster Network Policy on Google Cloud]
* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html[Installing Calico on Amazon EKS]

[#ingress-kubernetes]
=== Ingress
If you are using a managed service, you can check the rules created for the traffic coming from the load balancers and the allowed port range. The standard port range for Kubernetes load balancers (30000-32767) should be all that is needed here for ingress. If you are using transparent load balancers, you need to apply the ingress rules listed for load balancers above.

[#notes-on-aws-networkingl]
== Notes on AWS networking with machine provisioner
When using the EC2 provider for machine provisioner, there is an `assignPublicIP` option available in the `values.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
machine_provisioner:
  ...
  providers:
    ec2:
      ...
      assignPublicIP: false
----

By default, this option is set to false, meaning any instance created by machine provisioner will only be assigned a private IP address.

[#private-ips-only]
=== Private IP addresses only
When the `assignPublicIP` option is set to false, restricting traffic with security group rules between services can be done using the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group-ingress.html[Source Security Group ID parameter].

Within the ingress rules of the VM security group, the following rules can be created to harden your installation:

| Origin
| Purpose

| CIDR range of your choice
| Allows users to SSH into failed vm-based jobs and to retry and debug

|===

[#using-public-ips]
=== Using public IP addresses

When the `assignPublicIP` option is set to true, all EC2 instances created by machine provisioner are assigned **public** IPv4 addresses. Also, all services communicating with them do so via their public addresses.

When hardening an installation where the machine provisioner uses public IP addresses, the following rules can be created:
