CircleCI server uses a load balancer to manage network traffic entering and leaving the Kubernetes cluster.

The load balancer manages all traffic coming into the application. The load balancer is public by default, but can be made private.

== Make the frontend load balancer private

[WARNING]
====
**Webhooks:** If you choose to make the frontend load balancer private, the following conditions must be met, depending on your VCS, for webhooks to work:

* **GitHub Enterprise** – your CircleCI server installation must be in the same internal network as GHE.
* **GitHub.com** – set up a proxy for incoming webhooks and set it as override for the webhook host URL. This setting can be found in the CircleCI app UI under **Admin Settings** > **System Settings** > **Override webhook host URL**.
====

NOTE: The Private load balancers option only works with installations on CircleCI server on GKE or EKS.

In your values.yaml override file, set the following parameter to true. The parameter is false (public) by default.

[source,yaml]

nginx:
    private_load_balancers: false

NOTE: If you are changing this setting after the initial deployment of CircleCI server, you may need to delete the old public load balancer so that Kubernetes requests a new load balancer with the new configuration.
