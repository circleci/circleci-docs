Sometimes, you'll want to upload artifacts created during builds so you can view them later. The following is an example of how to do that:

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: python:3.6.0

    working_directory: /tmp
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Creating Dummy Artifacts
          command: |
            echo "my artifact file" > /tmp/artifact-1;
            mkdir /tmp/artifacts;
            echo "my artifact files in a dir" > /tmp/artifacts/artifact-2;

      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/artifact-1
          destination: artifact-file

      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/artifacts
```

Using the `store_artifacts` step, we upload 2 build artifacts: a file (`/tmp/artifact-1`) and a directory (`/tmp/artifacts`). Once the artifacts are successfully uploaded, you can view them in the **Artifacts** tab of the build page in your browser. There is no limit on the  number of `store_artifacts` steps a job can have.

Currently, `store_artifacts` takes 2 fields: `path` and `destination`.

  - `path` is a path to the file or directory to be uploaded as artifacts.
  - `destination` **(Optional)** is a prefix added to the artifact paths in the artifacts API. (default: the directory of the file specified in `path`)

## Accessing Artifacts via API

You can consume artifacts via our [API]( {{ site.baseurl }}/api/v1-reference/#build-artifacts).
