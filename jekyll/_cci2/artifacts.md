This document describes how to work with Artifacts in the following sections:

## Artifacts overview
{: #artifacts-overview }

Artifacts persist data after a job is completed
and may be used for storage of the outputs of your build process.

For example, when a Java build/test process finishes,
the output of the process is saved as a `.jar` file.
CircleCI can store this file as an artifact,
keeping it available after the process has finished.

![artifacts data flow]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/Diagram-v3-Artifact.png)

Another example of an artifact is a project that is packaged as an Android app where the `.apk` file is uploaded to Google Play.

If a job produces persistent artifacts such as screenshots, coverage reports, core files, or
deployment tarballs, CircleCI can automatically save and link them for you.

Find links to the artifacts under the "Artifacts" tab on the **Job page**.
Artifacts are stored on Amazon S3 and are protected with your CircleCI account for private projects.
There is a 3GB `curl` file size limit.

**Artifacts will be accessible for thirty days after creation**. If you are relying on them as a source of documentation or persistent content, we recommend deploying the output to a dedicated output target such as S3, or GitHub Pages or Netlify for static websites.

**Note:**
Uploaded artifact filenames are encoded
using the [Java URLEncoder](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URLEncoder.html).
Keep this in mind
if you are expecting
to find artifacts at a given path within the application.

## Uploading artifacts
{: #uploading-artifacts }

To upload artifacts created during builds, use the following example:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: python:3.6.3-jessie
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference

    working_directory: /tmp
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Creating Dummy Artifacts
          command: |
            echo "my artifact file" > /tmp/artifact-1;
            mkdir /tmp/artifacts;
            echo "my artifact files in a dir" > /tmp/artifacts/artifact-2;

      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/artifact-1
          destination: artifact-file

      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/artifacts
```

The `store_artifacts` step uploads two build artifacts: a file (`/tmp/artifact-1`) and a directory (`/tmp/artifacts`). After the artifacts successfully upload, view them in the **Artifacts** tab of the **Job page** in your browser. If you're uploading hundreds of artifacts, then consider [compressing and uploading as a single compressed file](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024275534?input_string=store_artifacts+step) to accelerate this step.
There is no limit on the number of `store_artifacts` steps a job can run.


Currently, `store_artifacts` has two keys: `path` and `destination`.

  - `path` is a path to the file or directory to be uploaded as artifacts.
  - `destination` **(Optional)** is a prefix added to the artifact paths in the artifacts API. The directory of the file specified in `path` is used as the default.

## Uploading core files
{: #uploading-core-files }

This section describes how to get [core dumps](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html) and push them as artifacts for inspection and debugging. The following example creates a short C program that runs [`abort(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/abort.3.html) to crash the program.

1. Create a `Makefile` with the following lines:

     ```
     all:
       gcc -o dump main.c
     ```

2. Create a `main.c` file with the following lines.

     ```C
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int main(int argc, char **argv) {
         abort();
     }
     ```

3. Run `make` and `./dump` on the generated program to print `Aborted (core dumped)`!

Following is a full `config.yml` that compiles the example C abort program, and collects the core dumps as artifacts.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: gcc:8.1.0
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    working_directory: ~/work
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: make
      - run: |
          # tell the operating system to remove the file size limit on core dump files
          ulimit -c unlimited
          ./dump
      - run:
          command: |
            mkdir -p /tmp/core_dumps
            cp core.* /tmp/core_dumps
          when: on_fail
      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/core_dumps
```

The `ulimit -c unlimited` removes the file size limit on core dump files. With the limit removed, every program crash creates a core dump file in the current working directory. The core dump file is named `core.%p.%E` where `%p` is the process id and `%E` is the pathname of the executable. See the specification in `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` for details.

Finally, the core dump files are stored to the artifacts service with `store_artifacts` in the `/tmp/core_dumps` directory.

When CircleCI runs a job,
a link to the core dump file appears in the Artifacts tab of the **Job page**.

## Downloading all artifacts for a build on CircleCI
{: #downloading-all-artifacts-for-a-build-on-circleci }

To download your artifacts with `curl`,
follow the steps below.

1. [Create a personal API token]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token)
and copy it to a clipboard.

2. In a Terminal window,
`cd` to a directory
where you want
to store the artifacts.

3. Run the commands below.
Use the table beneath the commands
to substitute actual values
for all variables that start with `:`.

```bash
# Set an environment variable for your API token.
export CIRCLE_TOKEN=':your_token'

# `curl` gets all artifact details for a build 
# then, the result is piped into `grep` to extract the URLs.
# finally, `wget` is used to download the the artifacts to the current directory in your terminal.

curl -H "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:build_num/artifacts \
   | grep -o 'https://[^"]*' \
   | wget --verbose --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" --input-file -
```

Similarly, if you want to download the _latest_ artifacts of a build, replace the curl call with a URL that follows this scheme:

```bash
curl -H "Circle-Token: <circle-token>" https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/latest/artifacts
```

You can read more about using CircleCI's API to interact with artifacts in our [API reference guide](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v1/#artifacts).

--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
`:your_token` | The personal API token you created above.
`:vcs-type`   | The version control system (VCS) you are using. Either `github` or `bitbucket`.
`:username`   | The VCS project account username or organization name for the target project. Located at the top left of the screen in the CircleCI application.
`:project`    | The name of the target VCS repository.
`:build_num`  | The number of the job (aka. build) for which you want to download artifacts.
