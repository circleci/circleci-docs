This document provides an overview of how to migrate from GitLab to CircleCI.

TIP: The link:https://circleci.com/developer/tools/configTranslator[CircleCI configuration translator] provides a way to convert your GitHub Actions or GitLab config into a CircleCI `config.yml` file. The configuration translator is currently in open preview.

**Tips provided by ImagineX Consulting**

[#sign-up-with-gitlab]
== Sign up with GitLab

Follow the steps on the link:/docs/first-steps/#github-gitlab-bitbucket-data-center[Sign Up and Try] page to connect your GitLab account with CircleCI, then follow the steps in the following sections to migrate your CI/CD setup to CircleCI.

[#build-configuration]
== Build configuration

If you are using link:/docs/gitlab-integration/[GitLab's CI/CD], you will need to migrate your build configuration. On GitLab, the build configuration is defined in a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root directory of your source code repository. If you use shell scripts to perform your build, you can reuse those scripts in CircleCI.

First, create a CircleCI build configuration file. In the root directory of your source code repository, create a folder named `.circleci` and create a file in that folder named `config.yml`. Next, follow the CircleCI documentation https://circleci.com/docs/config-intro/[here] to learn how to configure the `.config.yml` file.

The GitLab and CircleCI configurations will be different. It may be helpful to have both GitLab and CircleCI reference documentation open side-by-side to help with the conversion of the build steps:

* https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/[GitLab YML Reference]

* https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/[CircleCI YML Reference]

2+| Defining a job that executes a single build step
a|
[source, yaml]
----
job1:
  script: "execute-script-for-job1"
----

a|
[source, yaml]
----
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: "execute-script-for-job1"
----

2+| Specify a Docker image to use for a job.

a|
[source, yaml]
----
job1:
  image: node:10
----

a|
[source, yaml]
----
jobs:
  job1:
    docker:
      - image: node:10
----

2+| Define a multi-stage build pipeline. Job1 and Job2 run concurrently. Once they are done, Job3 runs. Once Job3 is done, Job4 runs.

a|
[source, yaml]
----
job1:
  stage: build
  script: make build dependencies

job2:
  stage: build
  script: make build artifacts

job3:
  stage: test
  script: make test

job4:
  stage: deploy
  script: make deploy

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
----

a|
[source, yaml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: make build dependencies
  job2:
    steps:
      - run: make build artifacts
  job3:
    steps:
      - run: make test
  job4:
    steps:
      - run: make deploy

workflows:
  jobs:
    - job1
    - job2
    - job3:
        requires:
          - job1
          - job2
    - job4:
        requires:
          - job3
----



2+| Execute jobs on multiple platforms. GitLab uses tags to identify build runners. CircleCI provides all major OSes and Docker and must explicitly set in config. See our https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/#section=configuration[execution environments documentation] for more information.

a|
[source, yaml]
----
ubuntu job:
  tags:
    - ubuntu
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $USER!"

osx job:
  tags:
    - osx
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $USER!"
----

a|
[source, yaml]
----
jobs:
  ubuntu-job:
    machine:
      # The image uses the current tag, which always points to the most recent
      # supported release. If stability and determinism are crucial for your CI
      # pipeline, use a release date tag with your image, e.g. ubuntu-2004:202201-02
      ubuntu-2004:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hello, $USER!"
  osx-job:
    macos:
      xcode: 14.2.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hello, $USER!"
----


2+| Cache Dependencies.

a|
[source, yaml]
----
image: node:latest

# Cache modules in between jobs
cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - node_modules/

before_script:
  - npm install

test_async:
  script:
    - node ./specs/start.js
----

a|
[source, yaml]
----
{% raw %}
jobs:
  test_async:
    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          key: source-v1-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - save_cache:
          key: source-v1-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
          paths:
            - node_modules
      - run: node ./specs/start.js
{% endraw %}

For larger and more complex build files, we recommend moving over the build steps in phases until you get comfortable with the CircleCI platform. We recommend this order:

. https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/[Pick your executor]
. https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#checkout[Checkout code]
. https://circleci.com/docs/env-vars/[Environment variables] and https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/[Contexts]
. Install dependencies, also see https://circleci.com/docs/caching/[Cache dependencies]
. https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#docker[Service containers]
. Run testing commands
. https://circleci.com/docs/custom-images/[Custom convenience images]
. https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#resourceclass[Resource classes]
. https://circleci.com/docs/workflows/[Workflows]
. https://circleci.com/docs/collect-test-data/[Test results] / test splitting / https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/[parallelism]
. https://circleci.com/docs/artifacts/[Artifacts]
