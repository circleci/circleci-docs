This guide will help you get started with a Ruby on Rails application on CircleCI.

## Overview
{: #overview }
{:.no_toc}

If you’re in a rush, just copy the sample configuration below into a
[`.circleci/config.yml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) in
your project’s root directory and start building.

CircleCI maintains a sample Ruby on Rails project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-ruby-rails) which you
can see building on
[CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-ruby-rails)

The application uses Rails version 6.1, `rspec-rails`, and
[RspecJunitFormatter][rspec-junit-formatter] with PostgreSQL as the database.


## Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images
{: #pre-built-circleci-docker-images }

This application build also uses one of the pre-built [CircleCI Docker
Images]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/circleci-images/).

Consider using a CircleCI pre-built image that comes pre-installed with tools
that are useful in a CI environment. You can select the Ruby version you need
from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cimg/ruby).

Database images for use as a secondary 'service' container are also available on
Docker Hub in the `circleci` directory.

## Sample configuration
{: #sample-configuration }

The following code block is commented to describe each part of the configuration
for the sample application.

{% raw %}

```yaml
version: 2.1 # Use 2.1 to enable using orbs and other features.

# Declare the orbs that we'll use in our config.

    # we run "parallel job containers" to enable speeding up our tests;
    # this splits our tests across multiple containers.

## Build the demo Ruby on Rails project yourself
{: #build-the-demo-ruby-on-rails-project-yourself }

A good way to start using CircleCI is to build a project yourself. Here's how to build the demo project with your own account:

1. [Fork the project][fork-demo-project] on GitHub to your own account.
2. Go to the [Add Projects](https://circleci.com/add-projects){:rel="nofollow"} page in CircleCI and click the Build Project button next to the project you just forked.
3. To make changes you can edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file and make a commit. When you push a commit to GitHub, CircleCI will build and test the project.

This app illustrates the simplest possible setup for a Ruby on Rails web app. Real-world projects tend to be more complex, so you may find these more detailed examples of real-world apps useful as you configure your own projects:

* [Discourse](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/discourse/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml), an open-source discussion platform.
* [Sinatra](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-ruby-sinatra), a demo app for the [simple DSL for quickly creating web applications](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).
