This guide will help get you started with a Ruby project on CircleCI 2.0. This walkthrough will be pretty thorough and will explain why we need each piece of configuration. If you’re just looking for a sample `config.yml` file, then just skip to the end.

If you want to follow along, fork our [example Rails app](https://github.com/circleci/cci-demo-rails) and add the project through CircleCI. Once you've done that, create an empty `.circleci/config.yml` in your project’s root.

Enough talk, let’s get started!

---

We always start with the version.

```YAML
version: 2
```

Next, we have a `jobs` key. Each job represents a phase in your Build-Test-Deploy process. Our sample app only needs a `build` job, so everything else is going to live under that key.

In each job, we have the option of specifying a `working_directory`. In this sample config, we’ll name it after the project in our home directory.

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/cci-demo-rails
```

This path will be used as the default working directory for the rest of the `job` unless otherwise specified.

Directly beneath `working_directory`, we can specify container images for the build under a `docker` key.

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/cci-demo-rails
    docker:
      - image: ruby:2.3
      - image: postgres:9.4.1
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: root
```

We use 2 Docker images here: `ruby:2.3` as the primary build image and `postgres:9.4.1` as the database image.

Now we’ll add several `steps` within the `build` job.

First we check out the codebase.

In our second step, we install NodeJS because Docker’s Ruby image doesn’t include it. This command will also install any tools/headers required to build native gems.

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  working_directory: ~/cci-demo-rails
  build:
    docker:
      - image: ruby:2.3
      - image: postgres:9.4.1
        environment:
          # POSTGRES_USER env var will set the default superuser in the image
          POSTGRES_USER: root

    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install System Dependencies
          command: apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential nodejs
```

Now we have to install our actual dependencies for the project.

```YAML
      - run:
          name: Install Ruby Dependencies
          command: bundle install
```

Next, set up the DB.

```YAML
      - run:
          name: Create DB
          command: bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load --trace
```

Rails will read `config/database.yml` and create a test DB automatically with `db:create` task. Ensure that `POSTGRES_USER` env var matches a username specified in your `database.yml`.

**(Optional)** If you want to create a DB manually, you can do with `createdb` command. We are installing postgresql package because we need `createdb` command.

```YAML
      - run: |
        apt-get update -qq; apt-get install -y postgresql
        createdb -h localhost my_test_db
```

Run our migrations.

```YAML
      - run:
          name: DB Migrations
          command: bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Finally, run our tests.

```YAML
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: bundle exec rake test
```

And we're done! Let's see the whole `config.yml`:

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: ruby:2.3
      - image: postgres:9.4.1
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: root

    working_directory: ~/cci-demo-rails
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install System Dependencies
          command: apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential nodejs
      - run:
          name: Install Ruby Dependencies
          command: bundle install
      - run:
          name: Create DB
          command: bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load --trace
      - run:
          name: DB Migrations
          command: bundle exec rake db:migrate
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: bundle exec rake test
```
