Matrix jobs provide a way to run a job multiple times with arguments. Arguments are supplied using parameters. There are many uses for this feature, including testing on multiple operating systems and against different language or library versions.

== Use matrix jobs to run multiple OS tests

In the following example, the `test` job is run across a Linux Docker container, Linux VM, and macOS environments, using two different versions of Node.js. On each run of the `test` job, different parameters are passed to set both the OS and the Node.js version:

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

  node: circleci/node@4.7

executors:

=== List jobs that will run

The expanded version of this matrix runs the following list of jobs under the `all-tests` workflow:
