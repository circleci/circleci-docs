This document contains all the external facing endpoints for the CircleCI's self-hosted runner API. This API is separate from the main CircleCI v2 API and is used for the management and execution of self-hosted runner jobs. It is hosted at `runner.circleci.com`

[#authentication-methods]
== Authentication methods

The CircleCI's self-hosted runner API contains different authentication methods. Each authentication method may be used in different endpoints for different purposes. Also, one endpoint may accept multiple authentication methods.

[#circle-token-personal-authentication]
=== Circle-Token (personal authentication)

This authentication method is based on personal tokens and follows the same rules for CircleCI v2 API.

[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Name
| Description

| Circle-Token header
| Header that contains the `<circle-token>` used to authenticate the user.

| http basic auth username
| The token can be provided using the Basic scheme, where username should be set as the `<circle-token>` and the password should be left blank.
|===

[#browser-session-authentication]
=== Browser session authentication

Ring-session sent through a cookie on the request. This authentication allows users that are already logged into circleci.com to access certain endpoints seamlessly.

[#resource-class-authentication-token]
=== Resource class token authentication

This token is generated when creating a new resource class. This token is only displayed once when creating a resource class, and cannot be retrieved again.
