The CircleCI's self-hosted runner API contains different authentication methods. Each authentication method may be used in different endpoints for different purposes. Also, one endpoint may accept multiple authentication methods.

[#circle-token-personal-authentication]
=== Circle-Token (personal authentication)

This authentication method is based on personal tokens and follows the same rules for CircleCI v2 API.
