This document provides information about pre-built CircleCI images and a listing by language, service type, and tags in the following sections:

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview
{:.no_toc}

For convenience,
CircleCI maintains several Docker images.
These images are extensions of official Docker images
and include tools especially useful for CI/CD.
All of these pre-built images are available in the [CircleCI org on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/).
Visit the `circleci-images` GitHub repo for the [source code for the CircleCI Docker images](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-images).
Visit the `circleci-dockerfiles` GitHub repo for the [Dockerfiles for the CircleCI Docker images](https://github.com/circleci-public/circleci-dockerfiles).

## Best Practices

Convenience images are based on the most recently built versions of upstream images,
so it is best practice
to use the most specific image possible.
This makes your builds more deterministic
by preventing an upstream image
from introducing unintended changes to your image.

CircleCI bases pre-built images off of upstream, for example, `circleci/ruby:2.4-node` is based off the most up to date version of the Ruby 2.4-node container. Using `circleci/ruby:2.4-node` is similar to using `:latest`. It is best practice to lock down aspects of your build container by specifying an additional tag to pin down the image in your configuration.

That is, to prevent unintended changes that come from upstream, instead of using `circleci/ruby:2.4-node` use a more specific version of these containers to ensure the image does not change with upstream changes until you change the tag.

For example, add `-jessie` or `-stretch` to the end of each of those containers to ensure youâ€™re only using that version of the Debian base OS. Pin down those images to a specific point version, like `circleci/ruby:2.3.7-jessie`, or specify the OS version with `circleci/ruby:2.3-jessie`. Specifying the version is possible for any of the CircleCI images.

It is also possible to specify all the way down to the specific SHA of the image you want to use. Doing so allows you to test specific images for as long as you like before making any changes.

There are two ways
to make an image more specific:

- Use a tag
to pin an image to a version or operating system (OS).
- Use a Docker image ID
to pin an image to a fixed version.

### Using an Image Tag to Pin an Image Version or OS
{:.no_toc}

You can pin aspects of a Docker image
by adding an [image tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/#extended-description).

For example,
instead of `circleci/golang`,
specify the version and OS
by using `circleci/golang:1.8.6-jessie`.
Because the second image specifies a version and OS,
it is less likely
to change unexpectedly.

See below for a list of the [Latest Image Tags by Language](#latest-image-tags-by-language).

**Note:**
If you do not specify a tag,
Docker applies the `latest` tag.
The `latest` tag refers to the most recent stable release of an image.
However,
since this tag may change unexpectedly,
it is best practice
to add an explicit image tag.

### Using a Docker Image ID to Pin an Image to a Fixed Version
{:.no_toc}

Every Docker image has a [unique ID](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier).
You can use this image ID
to pin an image to a fixed version.

Each image ID is an immutable SHA256 digest
and looks like this:

```
sha256:df1808e61a9c32d0ec110960fed213ab2339451ca88941e9be01a03adc98396e
```

#### Finding an Image ID
{:.no_toc}

1. In the CircleCI application,
go to a past build
that used the image.
2. On the **Test Summary** tab,
click the **Spin up environment** step.
3. In the log output,
locate the digest for the image.
4. Add the image ID to the image name as shown below.

```
circleci/ruby@sha256:df1808e61a9c32d0ec110960fed213ab2339451ca88941e9be01a03adc98396e
```

## Image Types

CircleCI's convenience images fall into two categories:
**language** images and **service** images.
All images add a `circleci` user as a system user.

**Note:**
The images below are based on the most recently built upstream images for their respective languages.
Because the most recent images are more likely to change,
it is [best practice](#best-practices)
to use a more specific tag.

### Language Images
{:.no_toc}

Language images are convenience images for common programming languages.
These images include both the relevant language and [commonly-used tools](#pre-installed-tools).
A language image should be listed first under the `docker` key in your configuration,
making it the [primary container]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/glossary/#primary-container){:target="_blank"} during execution.

CircleCI maintains images for the languages below.

- [Android](#android)
- [Clojure](#clojure)
- [Elixir](#elixir)
- [Go (Golang)](#go-golang)
- [JRuby](#jruby)
- [Node.js](#nodejs)
- [OpenJDK (Java)](#openjdk)
- [PHP](#php)
- [Python](#python)
- [Ruby](#ruby)

If your language is not listed,
CircleCI also maintains a [Dockerfile Wizard](https://github.com/circleci-public/dockerfile-wizard)
you can use to create a custom image.

#### Language Image Variants
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI maintains several variants for language images.
To use these variants,
add one of the following suffixes to the end of an image tag.

- `-node` includes Node.js for polyglot applications
- `-browsers` includes Chrome, Firefox, Java 8, and PhantomJS
- `-node-browsers` combines the `-node` and `-browsers` variants

For example,
if you want
to add browsers to the `circleci/golang:1.9` image,
use the `circleci/golang:1.9-browsers` image.

### Service Images
{:.no_toc}

Service images are convenience images for services like databases.
These images should be listed **after** language images
so they become secondary service containers.

CircleCI maintains images for the services below.

- [buildpack-deps](#buildpack-deps)
- [MariaDB](#mariadb)
- [MongoDB](#mongodb)
- [MySQL](#mysql)
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)

#### Service Image Variant
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI maintains only one variant for service images.
To speed up builds
using RAM volume,
add the `-ram` suffix to the end of a service image tag.

For example,
if you want the `circleci/postgres:9.5-postgis` image
to use RAM volume,
use the `circleci/postgres:9.5-postgis-ram` image.

## Latest Image Tags by Language

Below is a list of the latest convenience images, sorted by language.
For details about the contents of each image,
refer to the [corresponding Dockerfiles](https://github.com/circleci-public/circleci-dockerfiles).

**Note:**
Excluding [language image variants](#language-image-variants) and [the service image variant](#service-image-variant),
CircleCI does **not** control which tags are used.
These tags are chosen and maintained by upstream projects.
Do not assume
that a given tag has the same meaning across images!

{% assign images = site.data.docker-image-tags | sort %}
{% for image in images %}

### {{ image[1].name }}
{:.no_toc}

**Usage:** Add the following under `docker:` in your config.yml:  

`- image: circleci/{{ image[0] }}:[TAG]`

**Latest Tags:** <small>(view more available tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/{{ image[0] }}/tags/))</small>

<ul class="list-2cols">
{% assign tags = image[1].tags | sort %}
{% for tag in tags %}
<li>{{ tag }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
