Enable CircleCI jobs to go through a set of well-defined IP address ranges.

## Overview
{: #overview }

IP ranges is a feature for CircleCI customers who need to configure IP-based access to their restricted environments using existing wokflows and platforms. As part of this feature, CircleCI provides a list of well-defined IP address ranges associated with the CircleCI service. CircleCI jobs that have this feature enabled will have their traffic routed through one of the defined IP address ranges during job execution.

The feature is available to customers on a [Performance or Scale plan](https://circleci.com/pricing/). This feature consumes 450 credits from your account for each GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled. If you are looking to predict the cost, see CircleCI's [blog post](https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/) for futher information.

## IP ranges use cases
{: #use-cases }

IP ranges let you limit inbound connections to your infrastructure to IP address ranges that are verifiably associated with CircleCI.

Some example use cases where IP-based restricted access might be desired include:
- Accessing private artifact repositories
- Pulling dependencies from a CocoaPods proxy hosted behind a firewall
- Running test cases on an internal environment
- Performing integration testing against private AWS resources
- Deploying an internal app with sensitive data
- Granting access to a production network

## Example configuration file using IP ranges
{: #example-configuration }

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    circleci_ip_ranges: true # opts the job into the IP ranges feature
    docker:
      - image: curlimages/curl
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - run: echo “Hello World”
workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build
```

## List of IP address ranges associated with feature
{: #list-of-ip-address-ranges }

Jobs that have been opted into the IP ranges feature will have one of the following IP address ranges associated with them:

- 3.228.39.90
- 18.213.67.41
- 34.194.94.201
- 34.194.144.202

## List of IP address ranges for core services
{: #list-of-ip-address-ranges-for-core-services }

These are the IP address ranges for core services (used to trigger jobs, exchange information about users between CircleCI and GitHub etc):

- 18.214.70.5
- 52.20.166.242
- 18.214.156.84
- 54.236.156.101
- 52.22.215.219

- 35.174.249.131
- 3.210.128.175

### List of IP address ranges changelog
{: #list-of-ip-address-ranges-changelog }

#### 2021-08-23
* Added new items to the list of IP address ranges for core services.

The machine-consumable lists have also been updated to reflect the new IP address ranges.

#### 2022-04-06
* Added and removed new IPs as part of enabling Docker pulls to go through the list of IPs.

The machine-consumable lists have also been updated to reflect the new IP address ranges.

**Machine-consumable lists can be found by querying the DNS A records below:**

- IP address ranges *for jobs*: `jobs.knownips.circleci.com`.

- IP address ranges *for core services*: `core.knownips.circleci.com`.

- *All IP address ranges*:  `all.knownips.circleci.com`.

To query these, you can use any DNS resolver. Here's an example using `dig` with the default resolver:

```shell
dig all.knownips.circleci.com A +short
```

Notifications of a change to this list will be sent out by email to all customers who have at least one job opted into the IP ranges feature. **30 days notice** will be given before changes are made to the existing set of IP address ranges. This page and the machine-consumable list will also be updated when there are upcoming changes.

## Pricing
{: #pricing }

Pricing is calculated based on the data usage of jobs opted into the IP ranges feature. It is possible to mix jobs with and without the IP ranges feature within the same workflow or pipeline. Data used to pull in the Docker image to the container before the job starts executing does _not incur usage costs_ for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

This feature consumes 450 credits from your account for each GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

IP ranges usage is visible in the **Plan Usage** section of the CircleCI app:

On the **Resources** tab within the **Job Details** UI page, you can view approximations of network transfer for any Docker job, even those without the IP ranges feature enabled. This approximation can be used to predict the cost of enabling the IP ranges feature on a job without having to turn the feature on. See more details on the CircleCI [blog](https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/). You can also view whether or not the job has IP ranges enabled by viewing the IP Ranges badge.

## AWS and GCP IP Addresses
{: #aws-and-gcp-ip-addresses }

The machines that execute *all jobs* on CircleCI’s platform, not just jobs opted into IP ranges, are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and CircleCI's macOS Cloud (see below). An exhaustive list of IP addresses that CircleCI’s traffic may come from on these cloud providers’ platforms can be found by looking up each cloud provider's IP address ranges. AWS & GCP offer endpoints to find this information.

- [AWS](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json): CircleCI uses the *us-east-1* and *us-east-2* regions
- [GCP](https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json): CircleCI uses the *us-east1* and *us-central1* regions

CircleCI *does not recommend* configuring an IP-based firewall based on the AWS or GCP IP addresses, as the vast majority are not CircleCI’s machines. Additionally, there is *no guarantee* that the addresses in the AWS or GCP endpoints persist from day-to-day, as these addresses are reassigned continuously.

## CircleCI macOS Cloud
{: #circleci-macos-cloud }

In addition to AWS and GCP (see above), CircleCI's macOS Cloud hosts jobs executed by machines. The following IP address ranges are used by CircleCI macOS Cloud:

- 162.252.208.0/24
- 162.252.209.0/24
- 192.206.63.0/24
- 162.221.90.0/24
- 38.39.177.0/24
- 38.39.178.0/24
- 38.39.188.0/24
- 38.39.189.0/24
- 38.39.186.0/24
- 38.39.187.0/24
- 38.39.184.0/24
- 38.39.185.0/24
- 38.39.183.0/24
- 38.23.38.0/24
- 38.23.39.0/24
- 38.23.40.0/24
- 38.23.41.0/24
- 38.23.42.0/24
- 38.23.43.0/24
- 198.206.135.0/24
- 207.254.116.0/24
- 207.254.117.0/24
- 207.254.118.0/24
- 207.254.119.0/24

**IP ranges** is the recommended method for configuring an IP-based firewall to allow traffic from CircleCI’s platform.

macOS builds are automatically restricted within the IP ranges listed here. In other words, you do not have to explicitly set `circleci_ip_ranges: true` for macOS builds.

## Known limitations
{: #known-limitations}

- There is currently no support for specifying IP ranges configuration syntax when using the [pipeline parameters feature]({{site.baseurl}}/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration). Find more details in this [Discuss post](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/ip-ranges-open-preview/40864/6).

- IP ranges is currently available exclusively for the [Docker executor]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#machine), not including `remote_docker`. Jobs that attempt to use the IP ranges feature with a [Machine executor]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#machine), or with `setup_remote_docker`, will fail with an error. See this [Discuss post](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/fyi-jobs-that-use-the-ip-ranges-feature-and-remote-docker-will-begin-to-fast-fail-this-week/44639) for details.

- CircleCI is aware of a bug where on rare occassions, the IP address that is used during job execution is not from the well-defined set of IPs listed above.
