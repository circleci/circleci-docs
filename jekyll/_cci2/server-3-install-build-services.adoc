== Phase 3: Execution environment installation

=== Output Processor
==== Overview
Output processor is responsible for handling the output from Nomad clients. It is a key service to scale if you find your system slowing down. We recommend increasing the output processor replica set to scale the service up to meet demand.

Access the KOTS Admin Console. Get to the KOTS Admin Console by running the following, substituting your namespace: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>`

Locate and enter the following in Settings:

. *Output Processor Load Balancer (required)* -
The following command will provide the IP address of the service
+
```shell
kubectl get service output-processor --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```

. *Save your configuration*. You will deploy and validate your setup after you complete Nomad client setup.

=== Nomad Clients
==== Overview
As mentioned in the link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-overview[Overview], Nomad is a workload orchestration tool that CircleCI uses to schedule (through Nomad Server) and run (through Nomad Clients) CircleCI jobs.

Nomad clients are installed outside of the Kubernetes cluster, while their control plane (Nomad Server) is installed within the cluster. Communication between your Nomad Clients and the Nomad control plane is secured with mTLS. The mTLS certificate, private key, and certificate authority will be output after you complete the Nomad Clients installation.

Once completed, you will be able to update your CircleCI server configuration so your Nomad control plane is able to communicate with your Nomad Clients.

==== Cluster Creation with Terraform

CircleCI curates Terraform modules to help install Nomad clients in your cloud provider of choice. You can browse the modules in our link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform[public repository], including example Terraform config files (`main.tf`) for both AWS and GCP. Some information about your cluster and server installation is required to complete your `main.tf`. How to get this information is described in the following sections.

NOTE: If you would also like to set up Nomad Autoscaler at this time, see the <<#nomad-autoscaler-optional,Nomad Autoscaler>> section of this guide, as some of the requirements can be included in this Terraform setup.

// Don't include this section in the GCP PDF:

ifndef::env-gcp[]

===== AWS
You will need some information about your cluster and server installation to complete the required fields for the terraform configuration file (`main.tf`). A full example, as well as a full list of variables, can be found link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform/tree/main/nomad-aws[here].

* *Server_endpoint* - You will need to know the Nomad Server endpoint, which is the external IP address of the nomad-server-external Loadbalancer. You can get this information with the following command:
+
```shell
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```

* *Subnet ID (subnet)*, *VPC ID (vpcId)*, and *DNS server (dns_server)* of your cluster.
Run the following command to get the cluster VPC ID (vpcId), CIDR block (serviceIpv4Cidr), and subnets (subnetIds):
+
```shell
aws eks describe-cluster --name=<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
```
+
This will return something similar to the following:
+
[source, json]
{...
"resourcesVpcConfig": {
    "subnetIds": [
        "subnet-033a9fb4be69",
        "subnet-04e89f9eef89",
        "subnet-02907d9f35dd",
        "subnet-0fbc63006c5f",
        "subnet-0d683b6f6ba8",
        "subnet-079d0ca04301"
    ],
    "clusterSecurityGroupId": "sg-022c1b544e574",
    "vpcId": "vpc-02fdfff4c",
    "endpointPublicAccess": true,
    "endpointPrivateAccess": false
...
"kubernetesNetworkConfig": {
            "serviceIpv4Cidr": "10.100.0.0/16"
        },
...
}
+
Then, using the VPCID you just found, run the following command to get the CIDR Block for your cluster. For AWS, the DNS Server is the third IP in your CIDR block (`CidrBlock`), for example your CIDR block might be `10.100.0.0/16` so the third IP would be `10.100.0.2`.
+
```shell
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<YOUR_VPCID>
```
+
This will return something like the following:
+
[source, json]
{...
"CidrBlock": "192.168.0.0/16",
"DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-9cff",
"State": "available",
"VpcId": "vpc-02fdfff4c"
...}


Once you have filled in the appropriate information, you can deploy your Nomad clients by running the following command from within the directory of the `main.tf` file.

----
terraform init
----
----
terraform plan
----
----
terraform apply
----

After Terraform is done spinning up the Nomad client(s), it will output the certificates and keys needed for configuring the Nomad control plane in CircleCI server. Make sure to copy them somewhere safe. The apply process usually only takes a minute.

// Don't include this section in the AWS PDF:

ifndef::env-aws[]

===== GCP
You will need the IP address of the Nomad control plane (Nomad Server), which was created when you deployed CircleCI Server. You can get the IP address by running the following command:

----
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

You will also need the following information:

* The GPC Project you want to run Nomad clients in.
* The GPC Zone you want to run Nomad clients in.
* The GPC Region you want to run Nomad clients in.
* The GPC Network you want to run Nomad clients in.
* The GPC Subnetwork you want to run Nomad clients in.

You can copy the following example to your local environment and fill in the appropriate information for your specific setup.

```hcl
variable "project" {
  type    = string
  default = "<your-project>"
}

variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "<your-region>"
}

variable "zone" {
  type    = string
  default = "<your-zone>"
}

variable "network" {
  type    = string
  default = "<your-network-name>"
  # if you are using a shared vpc, provide the network endpoint rather than the name. eg:
  # default = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/<host-project>/global/networks/<your-network-name>"
}

variable "subnetwork" {
  type    = string
  default = "<your-subnetwork-name>"
  # if you are using a shared vpc, provide the network endpoint rather than the name. eg:
  # default = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/<service-project>/regions/<your-region>/subnetworks/<your-subnetwork-name>"
}


variable "server_endpoint" {
  type    = string
  default = "<nomad-server-loadbalancer>:4647"
}

provider "google-beta" {
  project = var.project
  region  = var.region
  zone    = var.zone
}


module "nomad" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform.git//nomad-gcp?ref=3.3.0"

  zone            = var.zone
  region          = var.region
  network         = var.network
  subnetwork      = var.subnetwork
  server_endpoint = var.server_endpoint
  machine_type    = "n2-standard-8"

  unsafe_disable_mtls    = true
  assign_public_ip       = true
  preemptible            = true
  target_cpu_utilization = 0.50
}

output "module" {
  value = module.nomad
}
```

Once you have filled in the appropriate information, you can deploy your Nomad clients by running the following commands:

----
terraform init
----
----
terraform plan
----
----
terraform apply
----

After Terraform is done spinning up the Nomad client(s), it will output the certificates and key needed for configuring the Nomad control plane in CircleCI server. Make sure to copy them somewhere safe.

==== Nomad Autoscaler
Nomad provides a utility to automatically scale up or down your Nomad clients, provided your clients are managed by a cloud provider's autoscaling resource. With Nomad Autoscaler, you only need to provide permission for the utility to manage your autoscaling resource and where it is located. You can enable this resource via KOTS, which will deploy the Nomad Autoscaler service along with your Nomad servers. Below we will go through how to set up Nomad Autoscaler for your provider.

NOTE: The maximum and minimum Nomad client count will overwrite the corresponding values set when you created your autoscaling group or managed instance group. It is recommended that you keep these values and those used in your Terraform the same so that the two don't compete.

If you do not require this service then feel free to jump to the *Save config* button to update your installation and redeploy server.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

===== AWS
. Create an IAM user or role and policy for Nomad Autoscaler. You may take one of the following approaches:
  * Our link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform/tree/main/nomad-aws[nomad module] creates an IAM user and outputs the keys if you set variable `nomad_auto_scaler = true`. You may reference the example in the link for more details. If you've already created the clients, you can update the variable and run `terraform apply`. The created user's access key and secret will be available in Terraform's output.
  * You may also create a Nomad Autoscaler IAM user manually with the IAM policy below. Then you will need to generate an access and secret key for this user.
  * You may create a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[Role for Service Accounts] for Nomad Autoscaler and attach the following IAM policy:
[source, json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:CreateOrUpdateTags",
                "autoscaling:UpdateAutoScalingGroup",
                "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": "<<Your Autoscaling Group ARN>>"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities",
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
. In your KOTS Admin Console, set Nomad Autoscaler to `enabled`
. Set Max Node Count* - This will overwrite what is currently set as the max for you ASG. It is recommended to keep this value and what was set in your Terraform as the same.
. Set Min Node Count* - This will overwrite what is currently set as the max for you ASG. It is recommended to keep this value and what was set in your Terraform as the same.
. Select cloud provider: `AWS EC2`
. Add the region of the autoscaling group
. You can chose one of the following:
.. Add the Nomad Autoscaler user's access key and secret key
.. Or, the Nomad Autoscaler role's ARN
. Add the name of the autoscaling Group your Nomad clients were created in

endif::env-gcp[]

ifndef::env-aws[]

===== GCP
. Create a service account for Nomad Autoscaler
  * Our link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform/tree/main/nomad-gcp[nomad module] creates a service acount and outputs a file with the keys if you set variable `nomad_auto_scaler = true`. You may reference the examples in the link for more details. If you've already created the clients, you can simply update the variable and run `terraform apply`. The created user's key will be available in a file named `nomad-as-key.json`.
  * You may also create a nomad gcp service account manually. The service account will need the role `compute.admin`.
. Set Nomad Autoscaler to `enabled`
. Set Maximum Node Count*
. Set Minimum Node Count*
. Select cloud provider: `Google Cloud Platform`
. Add your Project ID
. Add Managed Instance Group Name
. Instance group type: link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/#types_of_managed_instance_groups[Zonal or Regional].
. JSON of GCP service account for Nomad Autoscaler

endif::env-aws[]

==== Configure and Deploy

Now that you have successfully deployed your Nomad clients, you can configure CircleCI server and the Nomad control plane. Access the KOTS admin console. Get to the KOTS admin console by running the following command, substituting your namespace: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>`

Enter the following in Settings:

* *Nomad Load Balancer (required)*
+
```shell
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```

* *Nomad Server Certificate (required)* -
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

* *Nomad Server Private Key (required)* -
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

* *Nomad Server Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate (required)* -
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

* *Build Agent Image* - 
Consult customer support to set up

Click the *Save config* button to update your installation and redeploy server.

==== Nomad Clients Validation

CircleCI has created a project called https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck/tree/server-3.0[realitycheck] which allows you to test your Server installation. We are going to follow the project so we can verify that the system is working as expected. As you continue through the next phase, sections of realitycheck will move from red to green.

To run realitycheck, you will need to clone the repository. Depending on your Github setup you can do one of the following.

===== Github Cloud
----
git clone -b server-3.0 https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck.git
----

===== Github Enterprise
----
git clone -b server-3.0 https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck.git
git remote set-url origin <YOUR_GH_REPO_URL>
git push
----

Once you have successfully cloned the repository, you can follow it from within your CircleCI server installation. You will need to set the following variables. For full instructions please see the https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck/tree/server-3.0[repository readme].

.Environmental Variables
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Name
|Value

|CIRCLE_HOSTNAME
|<YOUR_CIRCLECI_INSTALLATION_URL>

|CIRCLE_TOKEN
|<YOUR_CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN>
|===

.Contexts
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Name
|Environmental Variable Key
|Environmental Variable Value

|org-global
|CONTEXT_END_TO_END_TEST_VAR
|Leave blank

|individual-local
|MULTI_CONTEXT_END_TO_END_VAR
|Leave blank
|===

Once you have configured the environmental variables and contexts, rerun the realitycheck tests. You should see the features and resource jobs complete successfully. Your test results should look something like the following:

image::realitycheck-pipeline.png[Screenshot showing the realitycheck project building in the CircleCI app]

=== VM service

VM service configures VM and remote docker jobs. You can configure a number of options for VM service, such as scaling rules. VM service is unique to EKS and GKE installations because it specifically relies on features of these cloud providers.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

==== AWS
. *Get the Information Needed to Create Security Groups*
+
The following command will return your VPC ID (`vpcId`), CIDR Block (`serviceIpv4Cidr`), Cluster Security Group ID (`clusterSecurityGroupId`) and Cluster ARN (`arn`) values, which you will need throughout this section:
+
```shell
aws eks describe-cluster --name=<your-cluster-name>
```

. *Create a security group*
+
Run the following commands to create a security group for VM service.
+
```shell
aws ec2 create-security-group --vpc-id "<YOUR_VPCID>" --description "CircleCI VM Service security group" --group-name "circleci-vm-service-sg"
```
+
This will output a GroupID to be used in the next steps:
+
[source, json]
{
    "GroupId": "sg-0cd93e7b30608b4fc"
}

. *Apply security group Nomad*
+
Use the security group you just created and CIDR block values to apply the security group to the following:
+
```shell
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr "<YOUR_serviceIpv4Cidr>"
```
+
```shell
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 2376 --cidr "<YOUR_serviceIpv4Cidr>"
```
+
NOTE: If you created your Nomad Clients in a different subnet from CircleCI server, you will need to rerun the above two commands with each subnet CIDR.

. *Apply the security group for SSH*
+
Run the following command to apply the security group rules so users can SSH into their jobs:
+
```shell
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 54782
```

. *Create user*
+
Create a new user with programmatic access:
+
```shell
aws iam create-user --user-name circleci-vm-service
```

Optionally, vm-service does support the use of a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[service account role] in place of AWS keys. If you would prefer to use a role, follow these https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[instructions] using the policy in step 6 below.
Once done, you may skip to step 9 which is enabling vm-service in KOTS.

. *Create policy*
+
Create a `policy.json` file with the following content. You should fill in Cluster Security Group ID (`clusterSecurityGroupId`) and Cluster ARN (`arn`) below.
+

. *Attach policy to user*
+
Once you have created the policy.json file attach it to an IAM policy and created user.
+
```shell
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name circleci-vm-service --policy-name circleci-vm-service --policy-document file://policy.json
```

. *Create an access key and secret for the user*
+
If you have not already, you will need an access key and secret for the `circleci-vm-service` user. You can create that by running the following command:
+
```shell
aws iam create-access-key --user-name circleci-vm-service
```

. *Configure server*
+
Configure VM Service through the KOTS admin console. Details of the available configuration options can be found in the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-operator-vm-service[VM Service] guide.

Once you have configured the fields, *save your config* and deploy your updated application.

==== GCP

You will need additional information about your cluster to complete the next section. Run the following command:

```shell
gcloud container clusters describe
```

This command will return something like the following, which will include network, region and other details that you will need to complete the next section:

[source, json]

. *Create firewall rules*
+
Run the following commands to create a firewall rule for VM service in GKE:
+
```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-internal-nomad-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --source-ranges "0.0.0.0/0" --rules "TCP:22,TCP:2376"
```
+
NOTE: You can find the Nomad clients CIDR based on the region by referring to the https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#ip-ranges[table here] if you have used auto-mode.
+
```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-internal-k8s-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --source-ranges "<clusterIpv4Cidr>" --rules "TCP:22,TCP:2376"
```
+
```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-external-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --rules "TCP:54782"
```

. *Create user*
+
We recommend you create a unique service account used exclusively by VM Service. The Compute Instance Admin (Beta) role is broad enough to allow VM Service to operate. If you wish to make permissions more granular, you can use the Compute Instance Admin (beta) role documentation as reference.
+
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create circleci-server-vm --display-name "circleci-server-vm service account"
```
NOTE: If your are deploying CircleCI server in a shared VCP, you will want to create this user in the project that you intend to have your VM jobs run.

. *Get the service account email address*
+
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="displayName:circleci-server-vm service account" --format 'value(email)'
```

. *Apply role to service account*
+
Apply the Compute Instance Admin (Beta) role to the service account.
+
```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --member serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/compute.instanceAdmin --condition=None
```
+
And
+
```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --member serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser --condition=None
```

. *Get JSON Key File*
+
After running the following command, you should have a file named `circleci-server-vm-keyfile` in your local working directory. You will need this when you configure your server installation.
+
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create circleci-server-vm-keyfile --iam-account <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

==== VM Service Validation

Once you have configured and deployed CircleCI server you should validate that VM Service is operational. You can rerun the reality checker project within your CircleCI installation and you should see the VM Service Jobs complete with green. At this point all tests should pass with green.

=== Runner

==== Overview

CircleCI runner does not require any additional server configuration. Server ships ready to work with runner. However, you do need to create a runner and configure the runner agent to be aware of your server installation. For complete instructions for setting up runner see the link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/runner-overview/?section=executors-and-images[runner documentation].

NOTE: Runner requires a namespace per organization. Server can have many organizations. If your company has multiple organizations within your CircleCI installation, you will need to set up a runner namespace for each organization within your server installation.
