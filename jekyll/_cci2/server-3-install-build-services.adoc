== Phase 3: Build services installation

=== Output Processor 
==== Overview 
Output processor is responsible for handling the output from Nomad clients. It is a key service to scale if you find your system slowing down. We recommend increasing the output processor replica set to scale the service up to meet demand. 

Access the KOTS admin console. Get to the KOTS admin console by running the following, substituting your namespace: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>`

Locate and enter the following in Settings: 

. *Output Processor Load Balancer (required)* - 
The following command will provide the IP address of the service 
+
```bash
kubectl get service output-processor --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```

. *Save your configuration*. You will deploy and validate your setup after you complete Nomad client setup.  

=== Nomad Clients 
==== Overview  
As mentioned in the link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-overview[Overview], Nomad is a workload orchestration tool that CircleCI uses to schedule (via Nomad Server) and run (via Nomad Clients) CircleCI jobs.

Nomad clients are installed outside of the Kubernetes cluster, while their control plane (Nomad Server) is installed within the cluster. The communication between your Nomad Clients and the nomad control plane are secured with mTLS. The mTLS certificate, private key, and certificate authority will be output after you complete the Nomad Clients installation. 

Once completed you will be able to update your CircleCI server configuration so your Nomad control plane is able to communicate with your Nomad Clients. 

==== Cluster Creation with Terraform

CircleCI curates Terraform modules to help install Nomad clients in your cloud provider of choice. You can browse the modules in our link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform[public repository] including example Terraform config files (man.tf) for both AWS and GKEs for `main.tf`. Some information about your cluster and server installation is required to complete your `main.tf`. How to get this information is described in the following sections.

===== AWS
You will need some information about your cluster and server installation to complete the required fields for the terraform configuration file (`main.tf`). A full example as well as a full list of variables can be found link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform/tree/main/nomad-aws[here]. 

* *Server_endpoint* - You will need to know the Nomad Server endpoint, which is the external IP address of the nomad-server-external Loadbalancer. You can get this information with the following command: 
+
```bash
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE> 
```

* *Subnet ID (subnet)*, *VPC ID (vpcId)*, and *DNS server (dns_server)* of your cluster. 
Run the following command to get the cluster VPC ID (vpcId), CIDR block (serviceIpv4Cidr), and subnets (subnetIds): 
+
```bash
aws eks describe-cluster --name=<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
```
+
This will return something similar to the following: 
+
[source, json]
{...
"resourcesVpcConfig": {
    "subnetIds": [
        "subnet-033a9fb4be69",
        "subnet-04e89f9eef89",
        "subnet-02907d9f35dd",
        "subnet-0fbc63006c5f",
        "subnet-0d683b6f6ba8",
        "subnet-079d0ca04301"
    ],
    "clusterSecurityGroupId": "sg-022c1b544e574",
    "vpcId": "vpc-02fdfff4c",
    "endpointPublicAccess": true,
    "endpointPrivateAccess": false
...
"kubernetesNetworkConfig": {
            "serviceIpv4Cidr": "10.100.0.0/16"
        },
...
}
+
Then, using the VPCID you just found, run the following command to get the CIDR Block for your cluster. For AWS, the DNS Server is the third IP in your CIDR block (`CidrBlock`), for example your CIDR block might be `10.100.0.0/16` so the third IP would be `10.100.0.2`.
+
```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<YOUR_VPCID>
```
+
This will return something like the following: 
+
[source, json]
{...
"CidrBlock": "192.168.0.0/16",
"DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-9cff",
"State": "available",
"VpcId": "vpc-02fdfff4c"
...}


Once you have filled in the appropriate information you can deploy your nomad clients by running the following from within the directory of the `main.tf` file. 

----
terraform init
----
----
terraform plan
----
----
terraform apply
----

After Terraform is done spinning up the Nomad client(s), it will output the certificates and keys needed for configuring the Nomad control plane in CircleCI server. Make sure to copy them somewhere safe. The apply process usually only takes a minute. 

===== GKE 
You will need the IP address of the Nomad control plane (Nomad Server), which was created when you deployed CircleCI Server. You can get the IP address by issuing the following command: 

----
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

You will also need the following information: 

* The GPC Project you want to run nomad clients in. 
* The GPC Zone you want to run nomad clients in. 
* The GPC Region you want to run nomad clients in. 
* The GPC Network you want to run nomad clients in. 
* The ID of the GPC subnet you want to run nomad clients in. 

You can copy the following example to your local environment and fill in the appropriate information for your specific setup. Once you have filled in the appropriate information you can deploy your nomad clients by running. 

----
terraform init
----
----
terraform plan
----
----
terraform apply
----

After Terraform is done spinning up the Nomad client(s), it will output the certificates and key needed for configuring the Nomad control plane in CircleCI server. Make sure to copy them somewhere safe.

==== Configure and Deploy
Now that you have successfully deployed your Nomad clients, you can configure CircleCI Server and the Nomad control plane. Access the KOTS admin console. Get to the KOTS admin console by running the following, substituting your namespace: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>` 

Enter the following in Settings: 

* *Nomad Load Balancer (required)*
+
```bash 
kubectl get service nomad-server-external --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```

* *Nomad Server Certificate (required)* - 
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

* *Nomad Server Private Key (required)* - 
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

* *Nomad Server Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate (required)* - 
Provided in the output from `terraform apply`

Click the *Save config* button to update your installation and re-deploy server.

==== Nomad Clients Validation

CircleCI has created a project called https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck/tree/server-3.0[realitycheck] which allows you to test your Server installation. We are going to follow the project so we can verify that the system is working as expected. As you continue through the next phase, sections of realitycheck will move from red to green. 

To run realitycheck you will need to clone the repository. Depending on your Github setup you can do one of the following. 

===== Github Cloud 
----
git clone -b server-3.0 https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck.git
----

===== Github Enterprise
----
git clone -b server-3.0 https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck.git
git remote set-url origin <YOUR_GH_REPO_URL>
git push
----

Once you have successfully cloned the repository you can follow it from within your CircleCI server installation. You will need to set the following variables. For full instructions please see the https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck/tree/server-3.0[repository readme]. 

.Environmental Variables
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Name
|Value

|CIRCLE_HOSTNAME
|<YOUR_CIRCLECI_INSTALLATION_URL>

|CIRCLE_TOKEN
|<YOUR_CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN>
|===

.Contexts
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Name
|Environmental Variable Key
|Environmental Variable Value

|org-global
|CONTEXT_END_TO_END_TEST_VAR
|Leave blank

|individual-local
|MULTI_CONTEXT_END_TO_END_VAR
|Leave blank
|===

Once you have configured the environmental variables and contexts, rerun the realitycheck tests. You should see the features and resource jobs complete successfully. Your test results should look something like the following: 

image::realitycheck-pipeline.png[Screenshot showing the realitycheck project building in the CircleCI app]

=== VM service

VM service configures VM and remote docker jobs. You can configure a number of options for VM service, such as scaling rules. VM service is unique to EKS and GKE installations because it specifically relies on features of these cloud providers.

==== EKS
. *Get the Information Needed to Create Security Groups*
+
The following will return your VPC ID (`vpcId`), CIDR Block (`serviceIpv4Cidr`), Cluster Security Group ID (`clusterSecurityGroupId`) and Cluster ARN (`arn`) values, which you will need throughout this section: 
+
```bash
aws eks describe-cluster --name=<your-cluster-name>
```

. *Create a security group*
+
Run the following commands to create a security group for VM service. 
+
```bash
aws ec2 create-security-group --vpc-id "<YOUR_VPCID>" --description "CircleCI VM Service security group" --group-name "circleci-vm-service-sg"
```
+
This will output a GroupID to be used in the next steps: 
+
[source, json]
{
    "GroupId": "sg-0cd93e7b30608b4fc"
}

. *Apply security group Nomad*
+
Use the security group you just created and CIDR block values to apply the security group to the following: 
+
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr "<YOUR_serviceIpv4Cidr>"
```
+
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 2376 --cidr "<YOUR_serviceIpv4Cidr>"
```
+
NOTE: If you created your Nomad Clients in a different subnet from CircleCI server, you will need to rerun the above two commands with each subnet CIDR. 

. *Apply the Security Group for SSH*
+
Run the following command to apply the security group rules so users can SSH into their jobs:
+
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id "<YOUR_GroupId>" --protocol tcp --port 54782
```

. *Create user*
+
Create a new user with programmatic access: 
+
```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name circleci-server-vm-service
```

. *Create Policy*
+
Create a `policy.json` file with the following content. You should fill in Cluster Security Group ID (`clusterSecurityGroupId`) and Cluster ARN (`arn`) below. 
+

}
----

. *Attach Policy to User* 
+
Once you have created the policy.json file attach it to an IAM policy and created user. 
+
```bash
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name circleci-server-vm-service --policy-name circleci-server-vm-service --policy-document file://policy.json
```

. *Create an access key and secret for the user*
+
If you have not already, you will need an access key and secret for the `circleci-server-vm-service` user. You can create that by running the following command:
+
```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name circleci-server-vm-service
```

. *Configure Server*
+
Configure VM Service through the KOTs admin console. The following fields need to be completed for VM service to operate correctly. 
+
** *AWS Region (required)* - This is the region the application is in.
** *Subnets (required)* - Choose a subnet (public or private) where the VMs should be deployed. If you haven’t created a unique subnet you can use the subnet of the cluster. Note that all subnets must be in the same availability zone. 
** *Security Group ID (required)* - This is the security group that will be attached to the VMs. It was created previously. 
** *AWS IAM Access Key ID (required)* - AWS Access Key ID for EC2 access.
** *AWS IAM Secret Key (required)* - IAM Secret Key for EC2 access.
** *AWS Windows AMI ID (optional)* - If you require Windows builders, you can supply an AMI ID for them here.

Once you have configured the fields, *save your config* and deploy your updated application. 

==== GKE 

You will need additional information about your cluster to complete the next section. Run the following: 

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe
```

This command will return something like the following, which will include network, region and other details that you will need to complete the next section: 

[source, json]

currentMasterVersion: 1.20.8-gke.900
currentNodeCount: 3
currentNodeVersion: 1.20.8-gke.900
databaseEncryption:
…
----

. *Create firewall rules*
+
Run the following commands to create a firewall rules for VM service in GKE:
+
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-internal-nomad-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --source-ranges "0.0.0.0/0" --rules "TCP:22,TCP:2376"
```
+
NOTE: You can find the Nomad clients CIDR based on the region by referring to the https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#ip-ranges[table here] if you have used auto-mode. 
+
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-internal-k8s-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --source-ranges "<clusterIpv4Cidr>" --rules "TCP:22,TCP:2376"
```
+
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create "circleci-vm-service-external-fw" --network "<network>" --action allow --rules "TCP:54782"
```

. *Create user*
+
We recommend you create a unique service account used exclusively by VM Service. The Compute Instance Admin (Beta) role is broad enough to allow VM Service to operate. If you wish to make permissions more granular, you can use the Compute Instance Admin (beta) role documentation as reference.
+
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create circleci-server-vm --display-name "circleci-server-vm service account"
```

. *Get the service account email address*
+
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="displayName:circleci-server-vm service account" --format 'value(email)'
```

. *Apply role to service account*
+
Apply the Compute Instance Admin (Beta) role to the service account. 
+
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --member serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/compute.instanceAdmin --condition=None
```
+
And 
+
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --member serviceAccount:<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser --condition=None
```

. *Get JSON Key File*
+
After running the following, you should have a file named `circleci-server-vm-keyfile` in your local working directory. You will need this when you configure your server installation. 
+
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create circleci-server-vm-keyfile --iam-account <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

. *Configure Server*
+
Configure VM service through the KOTS admin console: 
+
** *VM Service Load Balancer (required)*
This can be found using the following command:
+
```bash
kubectl get service vm-service --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
```
** *GCP project ID (required)* - 
Name of the GCP project the cluster resides.

** *GCP Zone (required)* - 
GCP zone the virtual machines instances should be created in for example “us-east1-b”.

** *GCP VPC Network (required)* - 
Name of the VPC Network.

** *GCP VPC Subnet (optional)* - 
Name of the VPC Subnet. If using auto-subnetting, leave this field blank.

** *GCP Service Account JSON Key File (required)* - 
Copy and paste the contents of your service account JSON file.

** *GCP Windows Image (optional)* - 
Name of the image used for Windows builds. Leave this field blank if you do not require them.

Click the *Save config* button to update your installation and re-deploy server.

==== Additional VM Service Configuration

* *Number of <VM type> VMs to keep prescaled (optional)* - By default, this field is set to 0 which will create and provision instances of a resource type on demand. You have the option of preallocating up to 5 instances per resource type. Preallocating instances lowers the start time allowing for faster machine and remote_docker builds. 
+
NOTE: that preallocated instances are always running and could potentially increase costs. Decreasing this number may also take up to 24 hours for changes to take effect. You have the option of terminating those instances manually, if required.

==== VM Service Validation

Once you have configured and deployed CircleCI server you should validate that VM Service is operational. You can re-run the reality checker project within your CircleCI installation and you should see the VM Service Jobs complete with green. At this point all tests should pass with green. 

=== Runner 

==== Overview 

CircleCI runner does not require any additional server configuration. Server ships ready to work with runner. However, you do need to create a runner and configure the runner agent to be aware your server installation. For complete instructions for setting up runner see the link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/runner-overview/?section=executors-and-images[runner documentation]. 

NOTE: Runner requires a namespace per organization. Server can have many organizations. If your company has multiple organizations within your CircleCI installation you will need to set up a runner namespace for each organization within your server installation.
