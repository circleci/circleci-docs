This document provides the basic concepts that a longtime Jenkins user needs to know when migrating from Jenkins to CircleCI.

[#quick-start]
== Quick start

CircleCI is a very different product from Jenkins, with a lot of different concepts on how to manage CI/CD, but it will not take long to migrate the basic functionality of your Jenkins build to CircleCI. To get started quickly, try these steps:

. *Getting Started:* Run your first green build on CircleCI using the xref:getting-started#[guide].
. *Copy-paste your commands from Execute Shell:* To simply duplicate your project exactly as it is in Jenkins, add a file called `config.yml` to a `.circleci/` directory of your project with the following content:

[,yaml]
----
    steps:
      - run: "Add any bash command you want here"
      - run:
          command: |
            echo "Arbitrary multi-line bash"
            echo "Copy-paste from 'Execute Shell' in Jenkins"
----

Some programs and utilities are xref:circleci-images#pre-installed-tools[pre-installed on CircleCI Images], but anything else required by your build must be installed with a `run` step. Your project's dependencies may be xref:caching#[cached] for the next build using the `save_cache` and `restore_cache` steps, so that they only need to be fully downloaded and installed once.

*Manual configuration:* If you were using plugins or options other than Execute Shell in Jenkins to run your build steps, you may need to manually port your build from Jenkins. Use the xref:configuration-reference#[Configuring CircleCI] document as a guide to the complete set of CircleCI configuration keys.

[#job-configuration]
== Job configuration

Jenkins projects are generally configured in the Jenkins web UI, and the settings are stored on the filesystem of the Jenkins server. This makes it difficult to share configuration information within a team or organization. Cloning a repository from your VCS does not copy the information stored in Jenkins. Settings stored on the Jenkins server also make regular backups of all Jenkins servers required.

Almost all configuration for CircleCI builds are stored in a file called `.circleci/config.yml` that is located in the root directory of each project. Treating CI/CD configuration like any other source code makes it easier to back up and share. Just a few project settings, like secrets, that should not be stored in source code are stored (encrypted) in the CircleCI app.

[#access-to-build-machines]
=== Access to build machines

It is often the responsibility of an ops person or team to manage Jenkins servers. These people generally get involved with various CI/CD maintenance tasks like installing dependencies and troubleshooting issues.

It is never necessary to access a CircleCI environment to install dependencies, because every build starts in a fresh environment where custom dependencies must be installed automatically, ensuring that the entire build process is truly automated. Troubleshooting in the execution environment can be done securely by any developer using CircleCI's xref:ssh-access-jobs#[SSH feature].

If you install CircleCI on your own hardware, the divide between the host OS (at the "metal"/VM level) and the containerized execution environments can be extremely useful for security and ops (see <<your-builds-in-containers,Your builds in containers>> below). Ops team members can do what they need to on the host OS without affecting builds, and they never need to give developers access. Developers, on the other hand, can use CircleCI's SSH feature to debug builds at the container level as much as they like without affecting ops.

[#plugins]
== Plugins

You have to use plugins to do almost anything with Jenkins, including checking out a Git repository. Like Jenkins itself, its plugins are Java-based, and a bit complicated. They interface with any of several hundred possible extension points in Jenkins and can generate web views using JSP-style tags and views.

All core CI functionality is built into CircleCI. Features such as checking out source from a VCS, running builds and tests with your favorite tools, parsing test output, and storing artifacts are plugin-free. When you do need to add custom functionality to your builds and deployments, you can do so with a couple snippets of Bash in appropriate places.

[#distributed-builds]
== Distributed builds

It is possible to make a Jenkins server distribute your builds to a number of "agent" machines to execute the jobs, but this takes a fair amount of work to set up. According to Jenkins' link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds[docs], "Jenkins is not a clustering middleware, and therefore it doesn't make this any easier."

CircleCI distributes builds to a large fleet of builder machines by default. If you use CircleCI cloud, then this just happens for you - your builds do not queue unless you are using all the build capacity in your plan. If you use CircleCI server, then you will appreciate that CircleCI does manage your cluster of builder machines without the need for any extra tools.

[#containers-and-docker]
== Containers and Docker

Talking about containerization in build systems can be complicated, because arbitrary build and test commands can be run inside of containers as part of the implementation of the CI/CD system, and some of these commands may involve running containers. Both of these points are addressed below. Also note that Docker is an extremely popular tool for running containers, but it is not the only one. Both the terms "container" (general) and "Docker" (specific) will be used.

[#containers-in-your-builds]
=== Containers in your builds

If you use a tool like Docker in your workflow, you will likely also want to run it on CI/CD. Jenkins does not provide any built-in support for this, and it is up to you to make sure it is installed and available within your execution environment.

Docker has long been one of the tools that is pre-installed on CircleCI, so you can access Docker in your builds by adding `docker` as an executor in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. See the xref:executor-intro#[Introduction to Execution Environments] page for more info.

[#your-builds-in-containers]
=== Your builds in containers

Jenkins normally runs your build in an ordinary directory on the build server, which can cause lots of issues with dependencies, files, and other state gathering on the server over time. Plugins are also available, but they must be manually installed.

CircleCI runs all Linux and Android builds in dedicated containers, which are destroyed immediately after use (macOS builds run in single-use VMs). This creates a fresh environment for every build, preventing unwanted cruft from getting into builds. One-off environments also promote a disposable mindset that ensures all dependencies are documented in code and prevents "snowflake" build servers.

If you run builds on your own hardware with link:https://circleci.com/enterprise/[CircleCI], running all builds in containers allows you to heavily utilize the hardware available to run builds.

[#parallelism]
== Parallelism

It is possible to run multiple tests in parallel on a Jenkins build using techniques like multithreading, but this can cause subtle issues related to shared resources like databases and filesystems.

CircleCI lets you increase the parallelism in any project's settings so that each build for that project uses multiple containers at once. Tests are evenly split between containers allowing the total build to run in a fraction of the time it normally would. Unlike with simple multithreading, tests are strongly isolated from each other in their own environments. You can read more about parallelism on CircleCI in the xref:parallelism-faster-jobs#[Running Tests in Parallel] document.
