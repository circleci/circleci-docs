This document describes the Performance Plan available to developers.

[#performance-plan]
== Performance Plan
The Performance Plan offers a set amount of credits across a variety of resource classes, per month, which you can customize depending on your build configuration and execution environment.

In addition to a higher amount of network usage included, the Performance Plan offers several improvements over the Free Plan:

[#access-to-ip-ranges]
=== Access to IP ranges
Configure IP-based access to restricted environments with IP ranges. Jobs that have this feature enabled will have their traffic routed through one of the defined IP address ranges during job execution.

For more information about this features, refer to the xref:ip-ranges#[IP ranges] page.

[#additional-resource-classes]
=== Additional resource classes
Access to some of the larger machine sizes on Docker, Linux, Windows, and macOS. The additional resource classes on the compute type/execution environment give you access to higher CPU and memory limits.

For more information about these resources, refer to the xref:executor-intro#[Executors and images] page.

[#less-queuing-with-more-concurrency]
=== Less queuing with more concurrency
A larger amount of jobs that can run concurrently in your workflows, as described below in <<#concurrency,Concurrency>>.

[#scalable-user-seat-count]
=== Scalable user seat count
Included is a set number of active users. Additional users can be added by using your credits. If you need more credits, they can be purchased to cover additional users on a per month basis. This process allows you to scale your credit package to align with build activity.

[#additional-self-hosted-runners]
=== Additional self-hosted runners
A significant increase in the amount of self-hosted runners, allowing you to run more jobs on your own infrastructure. See <<#self-hosted-runners,Self-hosted Runners>> below for more information.

[#custom-storage-retention]
=== Custom storage retention
The link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] allows for the customization of the storage retention periods of artifact, workspace, and cache objects. This allows you to determine how to store each of these objects types in a way that best suits your project. Lowering storage retention periods can also reduce your monthly bill.

[#additional-support-options]
=== Additional support options
Additional support through SLAs (limited hours and days), and support package add-ons. The Performance Plan also has access to the link:https://discuss.circleci.com/[community forums], link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us[support portal], and our link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[global ticket-based system].
