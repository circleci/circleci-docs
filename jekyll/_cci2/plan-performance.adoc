This document describes the CircleCI Performance Plan.

[#performance-plan]
== Performance Plan
The Performance Plan offers a set number of credits across a variety of resource classes, per month. You can customize your credit spend depending on your build configuration and execution environment.

The Performance Plan offers a higher amount of network usage, and other advantages over the Free Plan, as described below.

The Performance Plan offers *five* link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034783154-What-is-an-Active-User[active users], and you can increase this number as you grow. Each additional user is charges at 25,000 credits. Refer to the link:https://circleci.com/pricing#[pricing page] for details.

[#access-to-ip-ranges]
=== Access to IP ranges
Configure IP-based access to restricted environments with IP ranges. Jobs that have this feature enabled have their traffic routed through one of the defined IP address ranges during job execution.

For more information about this features, refer to the xref:ip-ranges#[IP ranges] page.

[#additional-resource-classes]
=== Additional resource classes
Access to some of the larger machine sizes on Docker, Linux, Windows, and macOS. The additional resource classes on the compute type/execution environment give you access to higher CPU and memory limits.

For more information, refer to the xref:executor-intro#[Execution environments overview] page.

[#less-queuing-with-more-concurrency]
=== Less queuing with more concurrency
A larger number of jobs can run concurrently in your workflows, as described below in <<#concurrency,Concurrency>>.

[#scalable-user-seat-count]
=== Scalable user seat count
Included is a set number of active users. Additional users can be added by using your credits. If you need more credits, they can be purchased to cover additional users on a per month basis. This process allows you to scale your credit package to align with build activity.

[#additional-self-hosted-runners]
=== Additional self-hosted runners
A significant increase in the number of self-hosted runners, allowing you to run more jobs on your own infrastructure. See <<#self-hosted-runners,Self-hosted Runners>> below for more information.

=== Releases

Visualise and control your deployments with CircleCI releases. Deployments to Kubernetes and SageMaker are supported.

On the Performance Plan, you get **three components** with associated releases per month. Each **additional component** is **40k credits**. Each release is **250 credits**. Components with no releases are not charged.

* A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit.

* A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services. A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

Start with the xref:release/releases-overview#[Releases overview] for more information on the feature.

[#custom-storage-retention]
=== Custom storage retention
The link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] allows for the customization of the storage retention periods of artifact, workspace, and cache objects. This allows you to determine how to store each of these objects types in a way that best suits your project. Lowering storage retention periods can also reduce your monthly bill.

[#additional-support-options]
=== Additional support options
Additional support through SLAs (limited hours and days), and support package add-ons. The Performance Plan also has access to the link:https://discuss.circleci.com/[community forums], link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us[support portal], and our link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[global ticket-based system].
