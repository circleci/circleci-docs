This document provides an overview of how to migrate from AWS CodeCommit to CircleCI.

NOTE: **Tips provided by ImagineX Consulting**

== Source Control Setup
If you are using AWS Code Commit, you will first need to migrate your source code to GitHub or BitBucket. See the following for details on how to import your code:

* https://help.github.com/en/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer[GitHub]
* https://help.github.com/en/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer[BitBucket]

=== GitHub Enterprise

Following are the steps required for using the git command line tool to import your code into GitHub Enterprise:

. Create an empty repository on your GitHub Enterprise instance.
. Create a bare clone of your external repository on your local machine, fetching all remote tags (refs/tags/\*) and copying all remote branch heads (refs/heads/\*) directly to their corresponding local branch heads.
+
```
git clone https://external-host.com/extuser/repo.git --bare
```
. Add your GitHub Enterprise repository as a remote reference in your local clone.
+
```
cd [repo-name]
git remote add enterprise git@[hostname]:[owner]/[repo-name].git
```
. Push all local references (refs/*) up to your remote GitHub Enterprise repository.
+
```
git push enterprise --mirror
```

Once you have imported your code into GitHub or BitBucket, you can start creating a project in CircleCI using the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/[Getting Started guide].


== Build Configuration

Next, you will need to migrate your build configuration. On AWS CodeBuild, the build configuration is either defined in the web interface or in a file called `buildspec.yml` in the root directory of your source code repository. If you use shell scripts to perform your build, you can reuse those scripts in CircleCI.

First, create a CircleCI build configuration file. In the root directory of your source code repository, create a folder named `.circleci` and create a file in that folder named `config.yml`. Next, follow the CircleCI documentation here to learn how to configure the `config.yml` file.

The AWS CodeBuild and CircleCI configurations will be different. It may be helpful to have both AWS DevOps and CircleCI reference documentation open side-by-side to help with the conversion of the build steps:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html[AWS CodeBuild Build Spec Reference]

* https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/[CircleCI YML Reference]

2+| Define a job that executes a single build step.

----
phases:
  build:
    commands:
       - ./execute-script-for-job1.sh

jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: "execute-script-for-job1"
----

2+| Specify a docker image to use for a job.

        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
----

2+| Define a multi-stage build pipeline. Job1 and Job2 run concurrently. Once they’re done, Job3 runs. Once Job3 is done, Job4 runs. An AWS CodeBuild project runs all commands sequentially. If you are running concurrent commands, you’re probably using CodePipeline and multiple CodeBuild projects.

          - job2
    - job4:
        requires:
          - job3
----

2+| Execute jobs on multiple platforms. An AWS CodePipeline project can target a single platform only. If you are targeting multiple platforms, you’re probably using CodePipeline and multiple CodeBuild projects. CircleCI provides executors for docker, Linux and MacOS that can be combined in a single build definition.

{
  "name": "windows project",

    "type": "WINDOWS_CONTAINER"
  }

2+| Cache dependencies.

# If custom cache is enabled in the web

npm install

  paths:
    - 'node_modules/**/*'

jobs:

    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          key: source-v1-< .Revision >

      - checkout

      - run: npm install

      - save_cache:
          key: source-v1-< .Revision >
          paths:
            - "node_modules"

For larger and more complex build files, we recommend moving over the build steps in phases until you get comfortable with the CircleCI platform. We recommend this order:

. Execution of shell scripts and Docker compose files
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/[Workflows]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/[Artifacts]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/[Caching]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/triggers/#section=jobs[Triggers]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/optimizations/#section=projects[Performance options]
