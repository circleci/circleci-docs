[#feature-highlights]
== Feature Highlights

*Machine Runner*

* Latest generation of machine-based runners.
* Full access to underlying operating system.
* Ideal for workflows requiring VM-level isolation.
* Consistent xref:variables#built-in-environment-variables[environment variables] with `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_*` prefix.
* Supports SSH connectivity for debugging.

*Container Runner*

* Kubernetes-native solution for container-based workflows.
* Fine-grained resource allocation and constraints.
* Supports service container configurations with pattern matching.
* Advanced node selection via Kubernetes annotations.
* Custom security contexts and volume mounting.
* Support for spot instances via tolerations.
* Configurable resource limits for primary and service containers.
* Supports SSH connectivity for debugging - xref:container-runner-installation#enable-rerun-job-with-ssh[Open preview].

[#key-differences]
== Key differences

*Machine runner* offers full VM isolation with the newest
configuration patterns and improved controls.

*Container runner* leverages Kubernetes for:

* Container-based isolation.
* Better scaling capabilities.
* Advanced resource management.
* Multiple architecture support.

[#choose-a-runner]
== When to choose each runner

*Machine runner*: Choose for full system access, custom system dependencies, or when Kubernetes is not available.

*Container runner*: Best for cloud-native applications, teams using Kubernetes, and workloads that benefit from container orchestration.
