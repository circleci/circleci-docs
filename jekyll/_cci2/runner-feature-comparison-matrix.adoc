[#feature-highlights]
== Feature Highlights

*Machine Runner*

* Latest generation of machine-based runners
* Full access to underlying operating system
* Ideal for workflows requiring VM-level isolation
* Consistent environment variables with `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_*` prefix
* Supports SSH connectivity for debugging

*Container Runner*

* Kubernetes-native solution for container-based workflows
* Fine-grained resource allocation and constraints
* Supports service container configurations with pattern matching:
* Advanced node selection via Kubernetes annotations
* Custom security contexts and volume mounting
* Support for spot instances via tolerations
* Configurable resource limits for primary and service containers


[#key-differences]
== Key Differences

*Machine runner* offers full VM isolation with the newest
configuration patterns and improved controls.

*Container runner* leverages Kubernetes for:

* Container-based isolation
* Better scaling capabilities
* Advanced resource management
* Multiple architecture support

[#choose-a-runner]
== When to Choose Each Runner

*Machine runner*: Choose for full system access, custom system
dependencies, or when Kubernetes isn’t available.

*Container runner*: Best for cloud-native applications, teams using
Kubernetes, and workloads that benefit from container orchestration.
