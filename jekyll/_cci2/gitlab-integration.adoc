[#overview]
== Overview

This document walks you through integrating a GitLab project with CircleCI. The sections below will introduce you to new concepts and ways to manage your CI/CD pipelines. We also outline what we are working on for future releases.

[#step-one-sign-up]
== 1. Sign up

GitLab support is open to both new and existing users of CircleCI. Follow the steps on the link:/docs/first-steps#gitlab-signup[Sign up and try CircleCI] page to: 

* Connect your GitLab account to create your organization.
* Create a project and connect a repository from your GitLab account.

When you connect a repo with your CircleCI project, behind the scenes, CircleCI is registering a webhook within your GitLab repository. You may verify this once you have successfully created the project by navigating to your repository's **Settings > Webhooks** page.

NOTE: You will need API access and write permissions on the repository you want to set up. Within GitLab, this is the “maintainer” role or higher.

[NOTE]
====
The following limits are currently in place:

- Each user can create up to three organizations.
- Each organization under a Free plan can have up to 10 projects.

If you need more organizations or projects, consider upgrading to a xref:plan-overview.adoc[Paid plan], or link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[contact our Support team].

====

[#step-two-trigger-pipeline]
== 2. Trigger a pipeline in CircleCI

At this time, setting up a new GitLab project does not automatically trigger a pipeline. Adding or editing a CircleCI configuration within the CircleCI web app is also not currently available.

. If you have not already done so, create a `.circleci` directory at the root of your GitLab repository, and add a `config.yml` file in that directory.
+
NOTE: If you are new to CircleCI, you may wish to get started with our <<hello-world#echo-hello-world-on-linux#,Hello World>> example, or take a look at some of our <<sample-config#,sample configurations>>. The <<configuration-reference#,Configuring CircleCI>> document is a full reference to the keys used in a `.circleci/config.yml` file.

. Push changes to your GitLab repository. You should see a pipeline running for the project within the CircleCI web app.

[#project-settings]
== Project settings

Unlike GitHub or Bitbucket projects, the GitLab integration introduces the concept of "standalone" projects that are not specific to a VCS.

A project can have one or more **configurations** which are pipeline definitions, including, but not limited to, a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo.

A project can have one or more **triggers**, which are events from a source of change, including, but not limited to, a VCS. A trigger determines which configuration it should use to start a pipeline.

The following settings are found by clicking the **Project Settings** button within your project. At this time, both configurations and triggers are limited to GitLab. To read more about other settings you can enable for your projects, refer to the <<settings#,Settings>> document.

[#people]
=== People

Project roles give control over which users have access to which projects within an organization. This enables teams to have limited access to only their projects, while managers and others can have broader organizational access. The access options are: 

* Admin: Read and write access to the project and all settings and ability to manage other users' access.
* Contributor: Read and write access to the project and some settings.
* Viewer: Read only access to the project and some settings.

For a complete list of permissions, see the <<#permissions-matrix>>.

image::/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-project-settings-project-roles.png[Project roles setup page]

[#configuration]
=== Configuration

Currently, you can add or delete a configuration source for your project. If you followed the steps above to connect GitLab, a GitLab configuration source has been automatically added for you. Once you define a configuration source, you can set up a trigger that points to that configuration.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-ga-project-settings-configuration.png[Configuration setup page]

[#triggers]
=== Triggers

Add a trigger that specifies which configuration source starts a pipeline. If you followed the steps above to connect GitLab, a trigger set with GitLab as the configuration source has been automatically added for you.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-ga-project-settings-triggers.png[Trigger setup page]

Triggers and trigger rules determine how CircleCI handles events from the source of change, in this case, GitLab.

When a trigger is created, CircleCI registers a webhook with GitLab. Push events from GitLab are sent to CircleCI. CircleCI then uses the event data to determine _if_ a pipeline should run, and if so, _which_ pipeline should be run.

In addition to a configuration source, each trigger includes the webhook URL, and in this scenario, a CircleCI-created GitLab token. The webhook URL and GitLab token are used to securely register the webhook within GitLab in order to receive push events from your GitLab repo.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-ga-project-settings-edit-trigger.png[Trigger details]

**Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should initiate a build based on the parameters provided by Gitlab’s webhook. CircleCI provides some common options, for example, only build on merge requests, but you can also build your own rules using the customer filter option. For example, a custom filter would allow you to only build on a specific branch or user.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-preview/gitlab-preview-project-settings-customize-triggers.png[Trigger details]

NOTE: Please also note the differences in functionality with the project settings below for GitLab support.

[#project-settings-advanced]
=== **Advanced**

- You can enable dynamic configuration using setup workflows in CircleCI. To learn about dynamic configuration, read the <<dynamic-config#,Dynamic Configuration>> guide.
- At this time, the **Free and Open Source** setting is not currently supported, but there are plans to make this available in the future.
- At this time, auto-cancel redundant workflows is not supported. Refer to the <<skip-build#auto-cancelling,Auto cancelling section>> of the Skip or cancel jobs and workflows document for more details.

[#project-settings-ssh-keys]
=== **SSH Keys**

When creating a project, an SSH key is created which is used to checkout code from your repo. Each configuration you create generates a new SSH key to access the code in the repo associated with that configuration. At this time, only **Additional SSH Keys** are applicable to GitLab projects. For more information on SSH keys, please visit the <<add-ssh-key#,Adding an SSH Key to CircleCI>> document.

[#organization-settings]
== Organization settings

The GitLab integration also introduces the concept of "standalone" organizations, which are not tied to a VCS.

A standalone organization allows for managing users and projects independent of the VCS. Organizations as well as users are considered CircleCI organizations and users, with their own roles and permissions that do not rely on those defined in a VCS.

To manage settings on the organization level, click the **Organization Settings** button within the CircleCI web app. More general information on organization settings in CircleCI can be found in the <<settings#,Settings>> document.

[#organization-settings-people]
=== People 

Add or remove users, and manage user roles for the organization as well as user invites.

NOTE: You must have at least one org administrator. If you try to remove the last org administrator, you will get an error.

[#inviting-your-first-team-members]
==== Inviting your first team members

Upon creating a new organization, you also have the option to invite team members from the dashboard. Alternatively, you may invite team members from the **People** section within **Organization Settings**.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-preview/gitlab-preview-org-settings-people.png[People section under Organization Settings]

. Click the **Invite** button.

. Enter the email address of the user you wish to invite, and select the appropriate role. You may enter multiple addresses at once, if you wish to assign these users the same role.
+
Organization administrator as well as organization contributor roles are currently available. Project-specific roles will be coming soon. For more information on roles and permissions, refer to the <<#about-roles-and-permissions,next section>>.

. An invited user will receive an email notification (sent from `noreply@circleci.com`), containing a link to accept the invite.
+
If they do not currently have a CircleCI account, they will need to sign up. If they already have a CircleCI account, they are added to the organization, and if they are logged in, they will see the organization as an option in the organization switcher in the top left corner of the web app.

[#about-roles-and-permissions]
==== About roles and permissions

CircleCI users have different abilities depending on assigned roles in a particular organization.

Your CircleCI user roles and permissions are not derived from your VCS permissions, and they do not allow you to bypass permissions in the VCS. For example, you may be an _Organization Administrator_ within CircleCI, which gives you access to view and modify organization and project settings _within your CircleCI organization_. However, you will not be able to edit a project’s `.circleci/config.yml` hosted in your VCS without your user also having the write permissions _within that VCS's repository project_. Your CircleCI user’s VCS permissions are determined by its associated GitLab identity.

At this time, your GitLab identity can be managed through your CircleCI connection when managing triggers and configuration.

[#user-settings]
== User settings

[#user-account-integrations]
=== Account integrations

In the **User Settings** section of your CircleCI user profile, you have the ability to enable multiple account integrations.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-ga-account-integrations.png[User account integrations page]

When you have connected a GitLab account, clicking **Connect** for an additional account integration (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket) will display the following modal:

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/gl-ga/gitlab-ga-connect-to-github-modal.png[Connect to GitHub modal]

Once you click **Connect** in the modal, your CircleCI accounts are merged. You will be disconnected from previously connected GitLab (i.e. standalone) organizations and will need to rejoin them. The disconnection ensures the security of your GitLab organizations as well as your other account integrations. 

To rejoin those organizations, you will need to be re-invited through the process as described earlier in the <<#inviting-your-first-team-members,Inviting your first team members>> section. 

The ability to connect to multiple account integrations on CircleCI allows you to:

- Easily access all source controls on your account
- Use all authentication methods available on CircleCI

[#pipeline-values]
== Pipeline values

GitLab-based triggers provide access to additional pipeline values. For more information on using pipeline values and parameters in CircleCI, refer to the <<pipeline-variables#,Pipeline Values and Parameters>> document.

[#deprecated-system-environment-variables]
== Deprecated system environment variables

GitLab-based projects do not have the following system environment variables available. If your pipelines need these environment variables, we recommend you use suitable replacements from the available <<#pipeline-values,pipeline values>>.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| `CI_PULL_REQUESTS`
| Comma-separated list of URLs of the current build’s associated pull requests.

| `CI_PULL_REQUEST`
| The URL of the associated pull request. If there are multiple associated pull requests, one URL is randomly chosen.

| `CIRCLE_PR_NUMBER`
| The number of the associated GitHub or Bitbucket pull request. Only available on forked PRs.

| `CIRCLE_PR_USERNAME`
| The GitHub or Bitbucket username of the user who created the pull request. Only available on forked PRs.

| `CIRCLE_PR_REPONAME`
| The name of the GitHub or Bitbucket repository where the pull request was created. Only available on forked PRs.

| `CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME`
| The GitHub or Bitbucket username of the current project.

| `CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME`
| The name of the repository of the current project.

| `CIRCLE_REPOSITORY_URL`
| The URL of your GitHub or Bitbucket repository.

| `CIRLCE_SHA1`
| The SHA1 hash of the last commit of the current build.

| `CIRCLE_TAG`
| The name of the git tag, if the current build is tagged. For more information, see the <<workflows#executing-workflows-for-a-git-tag,Git Tag Job Execution section>> of the Using Workflows to Schedule Jobs document. 

|===

If you must use these as environment variables in your pipelines, you can do so by <<env-vars#environment-variable-usage-options,using the `environment` key>> in your configuration and providing your own mappings: 

```yaml
build: 
  docker:
    - image: cimg/node:17.0
      auth:
        username: mydockerhub-user
        password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
  environment:
    CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name >>
  steps:
    - run: echo $CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME
```

[#coming-soon]
== Coming soon

The following sections are features of CircleCI which are not currently fully supported for GitLab. These features are planned for future releases.

[#account-integrations]
=== Account integrations

There is currently no method to manage the connection with GitLab outside of the project setup, trigger, and configuration settings. CircleCI is working on enabling users to manage their users’ GitLab identity as part of their user profile's account integration settings.

[#auto-cancel-redundant-workflows]
=== Auto-cancel redundant workflows

Auto-cancel redundant workflows is not currently supported. It is often used to remove noise from the pipeline page and lower the time to feedback for a commit. Refer to the xref:/skip-build#auto-cancelling[Skip or cancel jobs and workflows] page for more details.

[#passing-secrets-to-forked-pull-requests]
=== Passing secrets to forked pull requests

Passing secrets to forked pull requests is not a currently supported option for GitLab integrations.

[#stop-building]
=== Stop building

GitLab integrations do not currently support the **Stop Building** option that can normally be found in **Project settings**. The recommendation is to delete your webhooks in your GitLab repo if you no longer want a CircleCI pipeline to run.

[#ssh-rerun]
=== SSH rerun

Support for SSH rerun will only work if your user account has a Bitbucket or GitHub integration in addition to GitLab. Your user account's Bitbucket or GitHub SSH keys can be used for SSH reruns with GitLab. CircleCI will be adding functionality to allow users to manage SSH keys so SSH reruns are possible. SSH reruns do not get passed context secrets. CircleCI is working on providing administrators with greater control over the use of secrets and SSH reruns.

[#additional-ssh-keys-only]
=== Additional SSH keys only

Deploy keys and user keys are not used by GitLab integrations. GitLab keys are stored in **Project Settings > Additional SSH Keys**. However, CircleCI does not recommend manually managing your SSH keys for code checkout. Instead, use the **Set Up Project** option, or **Project Settings > Configuration**, to maintain connections to your repository.

[#free-and-open-source-setting]
=== Free and open source setting

Open source plans are not currently available to GitLab customers. CircleCI will keep the open source community up to date as work continues to support this.
