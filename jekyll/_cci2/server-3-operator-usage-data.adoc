CircleCI typically collects usage data, such as logs and other aggregated data, for the purpose of improving our products and services. We never collect personally identifiable information or information that is specific to your projects or accounts.

## Current Data Collected
Currently, Server 3.0 does not include the data collection service. The service will be included in a future release.

With any release, we will communicate what additional data will be collected.
