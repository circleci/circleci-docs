Server v3.x installation. If your issue is not addressed below, you can generate a support bundle or contact your
CircleCI account team.

## Start Admin Console

To restart the Admin Console, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl kots admin-console --namespace <namespace>
----

Open your browser and access http://localhost:8800 to see the Admin console.

## Generate Support Bundle
A support bundle is used by CircleCI engineers to diagnose and fix any issues you are experiencing. They are typically
requested when you open a ticket.

To download a support bundle to provide to CircleCI for support, select the *Troubleshoot* tab from the Admin console
menu bar, and then click *Analyze CircleCI Server*.

## Managing Pods

### Verify Pod Readiness and Status
Note: please check the `READY` column as well as `STATUS`. Even if the `STATUS` is `Running`, pods are not ready to
serve user requests. Some pods may take some time to become ready.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
api-service-5c8f557548-zjbsj 1/1 Running 0 6d20h
audit-log-service-77c478f9d5-5dfzv 1/1 Running 0 6d20h
builds-service-v1-5f8568c7f5-62h8n 1/1 Running 0 6d20h
circleci-mongodb-0 1/1 Running 0 6d20h
circleci-nomad-0 1/1 Running 6 6d20h
â€¦
----

To show only pods with a status besides `Running`, you can use --field-selector option.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase!=Running -n <namespace>
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
nomad-server 0/1 Error 0 5d22h
----

### Verify Pod Settings and Status
To show detail settings and status of pods:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe pods <pod-name> -n <namespace>
----

### Get Pod Logs
To show logs of pods:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
----

### Restart Pods
To restart specific pods, the easiest way is remove the pod. Kubernetes will automatically recreate the pod.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <name-space> --now
----
