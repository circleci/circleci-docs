= Execution environments overview
:page-description: An overview of all CircleCI execution environments.
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:

CircleCI offers several execution environments:

* Docker (x86 or Arm)
* Linux VM (virtual machine)
* macOS
* Windows
* GPU
* Arm VM

Each job defined in your project configuration is run in a separate execution environment, either a Docker container or a virtual machine.

== Executors

For each job in your project config you will specify an execution environment by assigning it an *executor*. An *executor* defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job, and which image to use to suit your job.

It is possible to specify a different executor and image for each job in your xref:configuration-reference#[.configuration file].

=== Images, containers, and virtual machines

An _image_ is a packaged system that has the instructions for creating a running environment.

A _container_ or _virtual machine_ is the term used for a running instance of an image.

For example:

* Jobs that require Docker images (`docker`) may use an image for Node.js, Python etc. The xref:circleci-images#[pre-built CircleCI Docker image] (convenience images) will help you get started. CircleCI convenience images are not a full operating system, so they generally make building your software more efficient.

* Jobs that require a complete Linux virtual machine (VM) image (`machine`) may use an Ubuntu version supported by the xref:configuration-reference#available-linux-machine-images[list of available machine images].

* Jobs that require a macOS VM image (`macos`) may use an Xcode version. A full list is available on the xref:using-macos#supported-xcode-versions[Using macOS] page.

=== Resource class

When you configure an executor it is recommended that you also specify a resource class to specify compute resource size (CPU and RAM).

* For an overview of resource classes, see the xref:resource-class-overview#[Resource class overview] page.
* For an overview of available resource classes per Plan, see the link:https://circleci.com/pricing/[Pricing page].

[#docker]
== Docker

CAUTION: *Legacy images with the prefix "circleci/" were https://discuss.circleci.com/t/legacy-convenience-image-deprecation/41034[deprecated]* on December 31, 2021. For faster builds, upgrade your projects with link:https://circleci.com/blog/announcing-our-next-generation-convenience-images-smaller-faster-more-deterministic/[next-generation convenience images].

To access the Docker execution environment, use the `docker` executor and specify an image. For a full list of convenience images, which are built by CircleCI, see the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=docker[CircleCI Developer Hub]

Find out more about the Docker execution environment on the link:/docs/using-docker/[Using Docker] page.

[#linux-vm]
== Linux VM

NOTE: *CircleCI cloud* The use of `machine: true` is deprecated. You must specify an image to use.

To access the Linux VM execution environment, use the `machine` executor and specify a Linux image. For a full list of `machine` images, see the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=machine[CircleCI Developer Hub]

[#macos]
== macOS

To access the macOS execution environment, use the `macos` executor and specify an image using the `xcode` key. For a full list of macOS images, see the link:https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/macos[CircleCI Developer Hub].

NOTE: If you want to run a macOS build on CircleCI server, you will need to use xref:runner-overview#[self-hosted runner].

  build: # name of your job
    macos: # executor type

      # with Xcode 14.2.0 installed
----

Find out more about the macOS execution environment on the xref:using-macos#[Using macOS] page.

[#windows]
== Windows

To access the Windows execution environment, you can either:

* Use the Windows orb and specify one of the default executors.
* Use the `machine` executor and specify a Windows image.

For a full list of `machine` images, see the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=machine[CircleCI Developer Hub].

[#self-hosted-runner]
== Self-hosted runner

CircleCI provides the ability to have self-hosted runners:

* xref:container-runner#[Container runner] using Kubernetes.
* xref:runner-overview#machine-runner-use-case[Machine runner] using Linux, Windows, and macOS virtual machines.

[#port-ranges]
== Port ranges

When using a machine executor, if a port range is hard coded, the range in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports` should be avoided. Port range 32768 - 60999 is used by the TCP stack to allocate ephemeral ports for connections. Ports in that range may have already been allocated by a previous connection, so collisions are possible.
