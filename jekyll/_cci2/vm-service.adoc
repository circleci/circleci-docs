This section outlines how to set up and customize VM service for your CircleCI installation, to be used for `machine` executor and remote Docker jobs.

NOTE: This is only available for installations on AWS, please contact your CircleCI account representative to request this for a static installation.

== Overview

VM service enables users of CircleCI Server, installed on AWS, to run jobs using the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images[Remote Docker Environment] and the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-machine[`machine` executor].

== Configuration

CAUTION: Any changes to management console settings requires downtime while the CircleCI application restarts.

To configure VM service, it is best practice to select the AWS EC2 option in the Management Console Settings. This will allow CircleCI to run remote Docker and `machine` executor jobs using dedicated EC2 instances.

You can provide custom https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[Amazon Machine Image] (AMIs) for VM service, as described in the sections below. If you do not provide any custom images, all `machine` executor and remote Docker jobs will be run on instances built with one of our default AMIs, which have Ubuntu 16.04, Docker version 18.06.3 and a selection of common languages, tools, and frameworks. See the https://github.com/circleci/image-builder/tree/picard-vm-image/circleci-provision-scripts[`picard-vm-image` branch of our image-builder repository] for details.

== Customizing VM Service Images

Customizing the VM service images for your installation of CircleCI will allow you to specify versions of Docker and Docker Compose, as well as install any additional dependencies that may be part of your CI/CD pipeline. You can create separate AMIs for jobs that use remote Docker or  the `machine` executor. If you choose not to use custom images, you will likely need to run additional install and update steps on every commit as part of your `config.yml` file.

You can provide a single custom AMI to use for both `machine` and remote Docker jobs using just the field marked '1' below, or, by providing a second custom AMI in the field marked '2', you can use different settings for each.

.Custom VM Service Images
image::vm-service-custom.png[Custom VM Service Images]

To build custom VM service images:

1. Clone our image builder repo: https://github.com/circleci/image-builder/tree/picard-vm-image
2. Open `aws-vm.json` in your editor and fill in the required groups. An access key and secret key are required to upload. Handle the key and secret process according to your requirements, but consider restricting the `ami_groups` to only within your organization
3. Run `packer build aws-vm.json`

Refer to https://packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html#ami_groups for more information
and see https://github.com/circleci/image-builder/blob/picard-vm-image/provision.sh for details about settings.

You will need to associate the `circleci` user with the image you want to use as shown in https://github.com/circleci/image-builder/blob/picard-vm-image/aws_user_data[this] example.

To enable the use of these custom images for your installation, you will need to provide the individual AMI IDs in the Settings accessible from the Management console (for example, `<your-circleci-id>.com:8800`).

== Defining Instance Types
There are two fields for defining the instance types you wish to use. The first is for the default instance type, and the second is to set the instance type to use when a Job specifies the `large` resource class.

== On Demand and Preallocated Instances
Remote Docker and `machine` executor instances are spun up on demand. It is also possible to preallocate instances to remain up and running, ready for remote Docker and `machine` jobs to be run (see the last two fields in figure 9).

WARNING: If https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/[Docker Layer Caching (DLC)] is to be used, VM Service instances need to be spun up on-demand. To ensure this can happen, **either** ensure any preallocated instances are in use, **or** set both remote Docker and `machine` preallocated instance fields to `0`.

NOTE: When using preallocated instances be aware that a cron job is scheduled to cycle through these instances once per day to ensure they don't end up in an unworkable state.

== Job and Instance Management

Jobs run using the remote Docker Environment, or the `machine` executor are scheduled and dispatched by the Nomad server to your Nomad clients and passed on to remote Docker or `machine` from there. This means jobs run on remote Docker and the `machine` executor can be monitored in the usual way, using the Nomad CLI. See our <<nomad#basic-terminology-and-architecture,Introduction to Nomad Cluster Operation>> for more about Nomad commands and terminology.

// add steps to find out statuses of Remote Docker and machine executor - would this be run `nomad node-status` from one of the nomad client instances? If so, how does a user navigate to a Nomad client instance?

NOTE: A cron job in scheduled to cycle all default and preallocated instanced at least once per day to ensure instanced don't end up in a dead/bad state.

== Accessing Remote Docker and `machine` instances
By default, private IP addresses are used to communicate with VM service instances. If you need to grant wider access, for example, to allow developers SSH access, this can be set using the checkbox in the VM Provider Advanced Settings.
