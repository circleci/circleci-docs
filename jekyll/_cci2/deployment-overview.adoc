[#introduction]
== Introduction

Once a software application has been developed and tested, it needs to be deployed and made available for its intended audience.
With CircleCI, you can deploy to virtually any target.

You can also configure CircleCI to integrate with other services for:

* QA and testing
* Feature management
* Deployment strategies such as blue-green or canary deployment

Customize your configuration to match your requirements, whether you need a fully automated process or one that requires manual approval.

NOTE: **Deploy to Kubernetes?** Refer to our xref:release/releases-overview#[Releases overview] page to start managing your releases in the CircleCI web app. CircleCI releases is in open preview.

[#the-basics-of-deployment]
== The basics of deployment

Here are the core concepts you need to get a deployment set up:

* **Deployment job**: To deploy your application, add a <<jobs-steps#jobs-overview,job>> to your `.circleci/config.yml` file and configure the job to run the steps you require.
+
TIP: Add a release log step to your deployment job to **view a log of releases** in the CircleCI web app. See the xref:release/configure-release-markers#[Release markers] guide to learn more.

* **Deployment parameters**: You may need to add environment variables and SSH keys to fulfill your deployment steps.
Environment variables can be:
** Defined within your configuration
** Added to the project itself through the CircleCI web app:
*** Add project-level <<set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project,environment variables>>
***  Add project-level <<add-ssh-key#,SSH keys>>

* **Manual approval**: If your deployment strategy requires a manual approval step, you can include a <<workflows#holding-a-workflow-for-a-manual-approval,hold/approve>> job in your workflow.
This job will create a manual approval button visible in the CircleCI web app workflows map.

If you need to restrict connections, consider enabling xref:ip-ranges#[IP ranges] for your deployment job.

[#using-orbs-to-simplify-deployment]
== Using orbs to simplify deployment

<<orb-intro#,Orbs>> are packages of reusable configuration.
For simpler deployment pipelines, you can use orbs to achieve the results you need with minimal configuration.
Orbs are available for many common deployment targets.

For example, the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-code-deploy[AWS CodeDeploy orb] has a pre-configured `deploy` job that you can include in your configuration with the single line `aws-code-deploy/deploy` once the orb has been invoked by adding the orbs stanza:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-code-deploy: circleci/aws-code-deploy@x.y
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@x.z
workflows:
  deploy_application:
    jobs:
      - aws-code-deploy/deploy:
          auth:
            - aws-cli/setup
          application-name: myApplication
          bundle-bucket: myApplicationS3Bucket
          bundle-key: myS3BucketKey
          deployment-group: myDeploymentGroup
          service-role-arn: myDeploymentGroupRoleARN
```

Under the hood, this orb creates, bundles, and deploys your application using your specified parameters set under the `aws-code-deploy/deploy` job declaration.

Check out the full range of available orbs in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[orbs registry]. If the orb you need has not been created yet, consider <<orb-author-intro#,authoring one>>!

[#using-images-to-simplify-deployment]
== Using images to simplify deployment

CircleCI provides maintained Docker images (convenience images) that contain the tools required for common deployment scenarios.
Convenience images provide fast spin-up times, reliability, and stability.
Visit the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=docker[CircleCI Developer Hub] to learn more about each convenience image:
