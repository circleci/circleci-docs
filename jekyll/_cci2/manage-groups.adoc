NOTE: If you authenticated your CircleCI account with xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab] or the CircleCI xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App], the content on this page applies to you.

Use groups to manage access to projects and features. By creating groups based on teams or roles within your organization, you can, for example, add a user to a group to give them access to all required projects (for example, mobile projects, DevOps projects). For more information about the roles available, and their associated permissions, see the xref:roles-and-permissions-overview#[Roles and permissions] overview page.

The how-to guides on this page provide steps for some common group management tasks.
