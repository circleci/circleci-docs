## Quickstart: demo JavaScript Node.js reference project

We maintain a reference JavaScript project to show how to build a React.js app on CircleCI with `version: 2.1` configuration:

- [Demo JavaScript Node Project on GitHub](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-react-app)
- [Demo JavaScript Node Project building on CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-react-app){:rel="nofollow"}

In the project you will find a CircleCI configuration file [`.circleci/config.yml`](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-react-app/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml). This file shows best practice for using version 2.1 config with Node projects.

## Build the demo JavaScript Node project yourself

A good way to start using CircleCI is to build a project yourself. Here's how to build the demo project with your own account:

1. Fork the project on GitHub to your own account.
2. Go to the Add Projects page in the CircleCI application and click the Set Up Project button next to the project you just forked.
3. To make changes you can edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file and make a commit. When you push a commit to GitHub, CircleCI will build and test the project.


## Sample configuration

Below is the `.circleci/config.yml` file in the demo project.

{% raw %}

```yaml
orbs: # declare what orbs we are going to use
  node: circleci/node@2.0.2 # the node orb provides common node-related configuration 

version: 2.1 # using 2.1 provides access to orbs and other features

workflows:
  matrix-tests:
    jobs:
      - node/test:
          version: 13.11.0
      - node/test:
          version: 12.16.0
      - node/test:
          version: 10.19.0
```
{% endraw %}

  
## Config walkthrough

Using the [2.1 Node orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node#jobs-test) sets an executor from CircleCI's highly cached convenience images built for CI and allows you to set the version of NodeJS to use. Any available tag in the [docker image list](https://hub.docker.com/r/cimg/node/tags) can be used.
 
The Node Orb `test` command will test your code with a one-line command, with optional parameters.

Matrix jobs are a simple way to test your Node app on various node environments. For a more in depth example of how the Node orb utilizes matrix jobs, see our blog on [matrix jobs](https://circleci.com/blog/circleci-matrix-jobs/). See [documentation on pipeline parameters](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration) to learn how to set a node version via Pipeline parameters.

Success! You just set up a Node.js app to build on CircleCI with version: 2.1 configuration. Check out [our projectâ€™s pipeline page](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-react-app) to see how this looks when building on CircleCI.
