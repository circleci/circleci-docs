This document provides a walkthrough of the [`.circleci/config.yml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) file for a NodeJS sample application.

## Quickstart: Demo JavaScript NodeJS Reference Project

We maintain a reference JavaScript NodeJS project to show how to build an Express.js app on CircleCI 2.0:

- <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-express" target="_blank">Demo JavaScript Node Project on GitHub</a>
- [Demo JavaScript Node Project building on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-express){:rel="nofollow"}

In the project you will find a CircleCI configuration file <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-express/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml" target="_blank">`.circleci/config.yml`</a>. This file shows best practice for using CircleCI 2.0 with Node projects.

## Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images

We recommend using a CircleCI pre-built image that comes pre-installed with tools that are useful in a CI environment. You can select the Node version you need from Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/node/>. The demo project uses an official CircleCI image.

Database images for use as a secondary 'service' container are also available.

## Build the Demo JavaScript Node Project Yourself

A good way to start using CircleCI is to build a project yourself. Here's how to build the demo project with your own account:

1. Fork the project on GitHub to your own account
2. Go to the [Add Projects](https://circleci.com/add-projects){:rel="nofollow"} page in CircleCI and click the Build Project button next to the project you just forked
3. To make changes you can edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file and make a commit. When you push a commit to GitHub, CircleCI will build and test the project.

## Config Walkthrough

Following is the `.circleci/config.yml` file in the demo project with comments.

{% raw %}
```
version: 2 # use CircleCI 2.0
jobs: # a collection of steps
  build: # runs not using Workflows must have a `build` job as entry point
    working_directory: ~/mern-starter # directory where steps will run
    docker: # run the steps with Docker
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2 # ...with this image as the primary container; this is where all `steps` will run
      - image: mongo:3.4.4 # and this image as the secondary service container
    steps: # a collection of executable commands 
      - checkout # special step to check out source code to working directory
      - run:
          name: update-npm 
          command: 'sudo npm install -g npm@latest'
      - restore_cache: # special step to restore the dependency cache 
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - run:
          name: install-npm-wee
          command: npm install
      - save_cache: # special step to save the dependency cache
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
          paths:
            - ./node_modules
      - run: # run tests
          name: test
          command: npm test
      - run: # run coverage report
          name: code-coverage
          command: './node_modules/.bin/nyc report --reporter=text-lcov'
      - store_artifacts: # special step to save test results as as artifact
          path: test-results.xml
          prefix: tests
      - store_artifacts:
          path: coverage
          prefix: coverage
      - store_test_results: # special step to upload test results for display in Test Summary
          path: test-results.xml
      # See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/ for deploy examples    
```
