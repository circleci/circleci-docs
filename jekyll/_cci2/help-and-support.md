If you're here, it's because you couldn't find what you were looking for in the docs. Our apologies!

There are 3 ways to ask for help:

## Ask on Discuss

Chances are you're not the first person to ask your question. That's why our first recommendation is to search our [community forums](https://discuss.circleci.com/).

If you can't find your question, post it yourself and one of our support engineers -- or another CircleCI user -- will provide some guidance.

## Create a Support Request

If you have a paid account, then you can ask directly for help from our support team. To create a support request, head to your [dashboard](https://circleci.com/dashboard/), click the round question mark button in the lower-right corner, then click 'Support'.

In the form that appears, enter a title for your question, along with a message detailing your problem. You can also attach files if you have a helpful screenshot or cute cat picture.

When you're done, click 'Submit support request', and one of our support engineers will get back to you soon.

## Premium Support

If you know you're going to need a rapid response to problems, then check out our [Premium Support](https://circleci.com/support/premium-support/). You can skip the line for support requests, get critical issues escalated, and access early features of CircleCI.
