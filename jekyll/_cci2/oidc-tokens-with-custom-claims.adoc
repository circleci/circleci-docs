:page-description: Learn about the capabilities to customize claims in OIDC tokens.

Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens to connect your pipelines to compatible cloud services without the need to manage long-lived secrets in CircleCI. Create CircleCI OIDC tokens, using the CircleCI CLI, and customize the `aud` claim to meet the unique needs of different cloud services.

For more information on OIDC token, see the xref:openid-connect-tokens#[OpenID Connect tokens] overview.

== Create OIDC token in a job with custom claims

CircleCI allows you to create OIDC tokens in a job. Using this method you can:

* Customize the `aud` claim. Only the `aud` claim is customizable.
* Create one or more OIDC tokens in a job.

Use the CircleCI CLI in a `step` to create your customized token, as follows:

NOTE: The `circleci run oidc` commands cannot be run locally via the CLI, only within a job in your CircleCI configuration.

[source,shell]
----
circleci run oidc get --claims '{"aud": "audience_name"}'
----

The above command creates an OIDC token with the `aud` claim set to `audience_name`, and returns the token to `stdout`.
Pass this value to a variable and use the variable to call a cloud service for authentication.

CAUTION: **OIDC tokens** created using this method can be printed with no masking. Take care to not log/print the token in your job steps.

[#example-configuration]
== Example configuration

This example configuration deploys a static HTML webpage to AWS S3 using an OIDC token, with a customized `aud` claim, in a job.
