Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens to connect your pipelines to compatible cloud services without the need to manage long-lived secrets in CircleCI. Create CircleCI OIDC tokens using the CircleCI CLI, and customize your claims to meet the unique needs of different cloud services.
See xref:openid-connect-tokens#[Default OpenID Connect tokens in jobs] for more information on default OIDC tokens provided by CircleCI in jobs.

[#create-oidc-token-in-a-job-with-custom-claims]
== Create OIDC token in a job with custom claims

CircleCI allows creation of OIDC tokens in a job. Multiple OIDC tokens can be created in a job with the option to customize claims. The CircleCI CLI may be used in a step to do this, as follows:

[source,shell]
----
circleci run oidc get --claims '{"aud": "audience_name"}'
----

The above command will create an OIDC token with the `aud` claim set to "audience_name", and return the token to `stdout`.
You may pass this value to a variable and use the variable to call the cloud service for authentication.

CAUTION: **The OIDC token** created by the above command can be printed with no masking, care should be taken to not log/print the token in the job steps.

[#example-configuration]
== Example configuration

Below is an example configuration that deploys a static HTML webpage to AWS S3 using OIDC token, with a customized `aud` claim in a job.

```yaml
version: 2.1

commands:
  install-awscli: # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install awscli
          working_directory: /tmp/awscli
          command: |
            curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
            unzip awscliv2.zip
            ./aws/install
            echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' | tee -a $BASH_ENV

          name: Deploy to S3
          command: |
            # set the variable AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE to a temporary file that will hold the OIDC token
            export AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE="$(mktemp -u)"
            # create OIDC token with customized aud claim of org-id
            OIDC_TOKEN=$(circleci run oidc get --claims '{"aud": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}')
            # copy the OIDC token to the AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE created earlier
            echo $OIDC_TOKEN > "$AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE"
            # make AWS cli calls
            aws sts get-caller-identity
