= Using Workflows to Orchestrate Jobs
:page-description: Learn about using CircleCI workflows to orchestrate jobs
:page-layout: classic-docs

Workflows help you increase the speed of your software development through faster feedback, shorter reruns, and more efficient use of resources. This document describes the workflows feature and provides example configurations.

[#overview]
== Overview

A *workflow* is a set of rules for defining a collection of jobs and their run order. Workflows support complex job orchestration using a simple set of configuration keys to help you resolve failures sooner.

With workflows, you can:

* Run and troubleshoot jobs independently with real-time status feedback.
* Schedule workflows for jobs that should only run periodically.
* Fan-out to run multiple jobs concurrently for efficient version testing.
* Fan-in to quickly deploy to multiple platforms.

For example, if only one job in a workflow fails, you will know it is failing in real-time. Instead of wasting time waiting for the entire workflow to fail and rerunning the entire job set, you can rerun _just the failed job_.

[#states]
=== States

Workflows may appear with one of the following states:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| State | Description

| RUNNING
| Workflow is in progress

| NOT RUN
| Workflow was never started

| CANCELED
| Workflow was canceled before it finished

| FAILING
| A job in the workflow has failed

| FAILED
| One or more jobs in the workflow failed

| SUCCESS
| All jobs in the workflow completed successfully

| ON HOLD
| A job in the workflow is waiting for approval

| NEEDS SETUP
| A workflow stanza is not included or is incorrect in the xref:configuration-reference#[.circleci/config.yml] file for this project
|===

[#workflows-configuration-examples]
== Workflows configuration examples

NOTE: For a full specification of the_ `workflows` _key, see the xref:configuration-reference#workflows[Workflows] section of the Configuration Reference.

To run a set of concurrent jobs, add a new `workflows:` section to the end of your existing `.circleci/config.yml` file with the version and a unique name for the workflow.

[#concurrent-job-execution]
=== Concurrent job execution

The following sample `.circleci/config.yml` file shows the default workflow orchestration with two concurrent jobs. It is defined by using the `workflows` key named `build_and_test`, and by nesting the `jobs` key with a list of job names. The jobs have no dependencies defined, so they will run concurrently.

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
workflows:
  build_and_test:
    jobs:

      - test
----

See the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/blob/parallel-jobs/.circleci/config.yml[Sample concurrent workflow config] for a full example.

When using workflows, try to do the following:

* Move the quickest jobs up to the start of your workflows. For example, lint or syntax checking should happen before longer-running, more computationally expensive jobs.
* Using a "setup" job at the _start_ of a workflow can be helpful to do some preflight checks and populate a workspace for all the following jobs.

Consider reading the xref:optimizations#[Optimization overview] for more tips related to improving your configuration.

[#sequential-job-execution]
=== Sequential job execution

The following example shows a workflow with four sequential jobs. The jobs run according to configured requirements, each job waiting to start until the required job finishes successfully as illustrated in the diagram.

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/sequential_workflow.png[Sequential Job Execution Workflow]

The following `config.yml` snippet is an example of a workflow configured for sequential job execution:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-test-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test1:
          requires:
            - build
      - test2:
          requires:
            - test1
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test2
----

The dependencies are defined by setting the `requires` key as shown. The `deploy` job will not run until the `build` and `test1` and `test2` jobs complete successfully. A job must wait until all upstream jobs in the dependency graph have run. So, the `deploy` job waits for the `test2` job, the `test2` job waits for the `test1` job and the `test1` job waits for the `build` job.

See the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/blob/sequential-branch-filter/.circleci/config.yml[Sample Sequential Workflow config] for a full example.

[#fan-outfan-in-workflow]
=== Fan-out/fan-in workflow

The illustrated example workflow runs a common build job, then fans-out to run a set of acceptance test jobs concurrently, and finally fans-in to run a common deploy job.

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/fan-out-in.png[Fan-out and Fan-in Workflow]

The following `config.yml` snippet is an example of a workflow configured for fan-out/fan-in job execution:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build_accept_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - acceptance_test_1:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_2:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_3:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_4:
          requires:
            - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - acceptance_test_1
            - acceptance_test_2
            - acceptance_test_3
            - acceptance_test_4
----

In this example, as soon as the `build` job finishes successfully, all four acceptance test jobs start. The `deploy` job must wait for all four acceptance test jobs to complete successfully before it starts.

See the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/tree/fan-in-fan-out[Sample Fan-in/Fan-out Workflow config] for a full example.

[#holding-a-workflow-for-a-manual-approval]
== Holding a workflow for a manual approval

Workflows can be configured to wait for manual approval of a job before continuing to the next job. Anyone who has push access to the repository can click the *Approval* button to continue the workflow. To do this, add a job to the `jobs` list with the key `type: approval`.

The following is a config example, with comments:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
# << your config for the build, test1, test2, and deploy jobs >>
# ...

workflows:
  build-test-and-approval-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build  # your custom job from your config, that builds your code
      - test1: # your custom job; runs test suite 1
          requires: # test1 will not run until the `build` job is completed.
            - build
      - test2: # another custom job; runs test suite 2,
          requires: # test2 is dependent on the success of job `test1`
            - test1
      - hold: # <<< A job that will require manual approval in the CircleCI web application.
          type: approval # <<< This key-value pair will set your workflow to a status of "On Hold"
          requires: # We only run the "hold" job when test2 has succeeded
           - test2
      # On approval of the `hold` job, any successive job that requires the `hold` job will run.
      # In this case, a user is manually triggering the deploy job.
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - hold
----

The outcome of the above example is that the `deploy` job will not run until
you click the `hold` job in the *Workflows* page of the CircleCI app and then
click *Approve*. In this example, the purpose of the `hold` job is to wait for
approval to begin deployment. A job can be approved for up to 90 days after
being issued.

Some things to keep in mind when using manual approval in a workflow:

* `approval` is a special job type that is *only* available to jobs under the `workflow` key
* The `hold` job must be a unique name not used by any other job.
* that is, your custom configured jobs, such as `build` or `test1` in the example above wouldn't be given a `type: approval` key.
* The name of the job to hold is arbitrary - it could be `wait` or `pause`, for example, as long as the job has a `type: approval` key in it.
* All jobs that are to run after a manually approved job _must_ `require` the name of that job. Refer to the `deploy` job in the above example.
* Jobs run in the order defined until the workflow processes a job with the `type: approval` key followed by a job on which it depends.

The following screenshot demonstrates a workflow on hold.

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/approval_job_cloud.png[Approved Jobs in On Hold Workflow]

By clicking on the pending job's name (`build`, in the screenshot above), an approval dialog box appears requesting that you approve or cancel the holding job.

After approving, the rest of the workflow runs as directed.

[#scheduling-a-workflow]
== Scheduling a workflow

NOTE: *The deprecation of the scheduled workflows feature has been postponed*. Since the deprecation announcement went live, your feedback and feature requests have been monitored and it is clear there is more work to do in order to improve the existing scheduled pipelines experience, and also make migration easier for all. Updates on a new deprecation timeline will be announced here and on link:https://discuss.circleci.com/[CircleCI Discuss].

Runing a workflow for every commit for every branch can be inefficient and expensive. Instead, you can schedule a workflow to run at a certain time for specific branches. This will disable commits from triggering jobs on those branches.

Consider running workflows that are resource-intensive or that generate reports on a schedule rather than on every commit by adding a `triggers` key to the configuration. The `triggers` key is *only* added under your `workflows` key. This feature enables you to schedule a workflow run by using `cron` syntax to represent Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for specified branches.

If you do not configure any workflows in your `.circleci/config.yml`, an implicit workflow is used. If you declare a workflow to run a scheduled build, the implicit workflow is no longer run. You must add your workflow to your `config.yml` in order for CircleCI to also build on every commit.

NOTE: When you schedule a workflow, the workflow will be counted as an individual user seat.

[#nightly-example]
=== Nightly example

By default, a workflow is triggered on every `git push`. To trigger a workflow on a schedule, add the `triggers` key to the workflow and specify a `schedule`.

In the example below, the `nightly` workflow is configured to run every day at 12:00am UTC. The `cron` key is specified using POSIX `crontab` syntax, see the link:https://www.unix.com/man-page/POSIX/1posix/crontab/[crontab man page] for `cron` syntax basics. The workflow will be run on the `main` and `beta` branches.

NOTE: Scheduled workflows may be delayed by up to 15 minutes. This is done to maintain reliability during busy times such as 12:00am UTC. Do not assume that scheduled workflows are started with to-the-minute accuracy.

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  commit:
    jobs:
      - test
      - deploy
  nightly:
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "0 0 * * *"
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - main
                - beta
    jobs:
      - coverage
----

In the above example, the `commit` workflow has no `triggers` key and will run on every `git push`. The `nightly` workflow has a `triggers` key and will run on the specified `schedule`.

[#specifying-a-valid-schedule]
=== Specifying a valid schedule

A valid `schedule` requires a `cron` key and a `filters` key.

The value of the `cron` key must be a link:https://crontab.guru/[valid crontab entry].

The following are *not* supported:

* Cron step syntax (for example, `*/1`, `*/20`).
* Range elements within comma-separated lists of elements.
* Range elements for days (for example, `Tue-Sat`).

Use comma-separated digits instead.

Example *invalid* cron range syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "5 4 * * 1,3-5,6" # < the range separator with `-` is invalid
----

Example *valid* cron range syntax:

[,yaml]
----
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "5 4 * * 1,3,4,5,6"
----

The value of the `filters` key must be a map that defines rules for execution on specific branches.

For more details, see the `branches` section of the link:/docs/configuration-reference/#branches-1[Configuring CircleCI] document.

For a full configuration example, see the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/blob/try-schedule-workflow/.circleci/config.yml[Sample Scheduled Workflows configuration].

[#using-contexts-and-filtering-in-your-workflows]
== Using contexts and filtering in your workflows

The following sections provide example for using Contexts and filters to manage job execution.

[#using-job-contexts-to-share-environment-variables]
=== Using job contexts to share environment variables

The following example shows a workflow with four sequential jobs that use a context to share environment variables. See the xref:contexts#[Contexts] document for detailed instructions on this setting in the application.

The following `config.yml` snippet is an example of a sequential job workflow configured to use the resources defined in the `org-global` context:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-test-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test1:
          requires:
            - build
          context: org-global
      - test2:
          requires:
            - test1
          context: org-global
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test2
----

The environment variables are defined by setting the `context` key as shown to the default name `org-global`. The `test1` and `test2` jobs in this workflows example will use the same shared environment variables when initiated by a user who is part of the organization. By default, all projects in an organization have access to contexts set for that organization.

[#branch-level-job-execution]
=== Branch-level job execution

The following example shows a workflow configured with jobs on three branches: Dev, Stage, and Pre-Prod. Workflows will ignore `branches` keys nested under `jobs` configuration, so if you use job-level branching and later add workflows, you must remove the branching at the job level and instead declare it in the workflows section of your `.circleci/config.yml`, as follows:

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/branch_level.png[Branch-Level Job Execution]

The following `.circleci/config.yml` snippet is an example of a workflow configured for branch-level job execution:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  dev_stage_pre-prod:
    jobs:
      - test_dev:
          filters:  # using regex filters requires the entire branch to match
            branches:
              only:  # only branches matching the below regex filters will run
                - dev
                - /user-.*/
      - test_stage:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: stage
      - test_pre-prod:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: /pre-prod(?:-.+)?$/
----

For more information on regular expressions, see the <<using-regular-expressions-to-filter-tags-and-branches,Using Regular Expressions to Filter Tags And Branches>> section below.

For a full example of workflows, see the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/blob/sequential-branch-filter/.circleci/config.yml[configuration file] for the Sample Sequential Workflow With Branching project.

[#executing-workflows-for-a-git-tag]
=== Executing workflows for a git tag

CircleCI does not run workflows for tags unless you explicitly specify tag filters. Additionally, if a job requires any other jobs (directly or indirectly), you must <<using-regular-expressions-to-filter-tags-and-branches,use regular expressions>>
to specify tag filters for those jobs. Both lightweight and annotated tags are supported.

In the example below, two workflows are defined:

* `untagged-build` runs the `build` job for all branches.
* `tagged-build` runs `build` for all branches *and* all tags starting with `v`.

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  untagged-build:
    jobs:
      - build
  tagged-build:
    jobs:
      - build:
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v.*/
----

In the example below, two jobs are defined within the `build-n-deploy` workflow:

* The `build` job runs for all branches and all tags.
* The `deploy` job runs for no branches and only for tags starting with 'v'.

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-n-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build:
          filters:  # required since `deploy` has tag filters AND requires `build`
            tags:
              only: /.*/
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v.*/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
----

In the example below, three jobs are defined with the `build-test-deploy` workflow:

* The `build` job runs for all branches and only tags starting with 'config-test'.
* The `test` job runs for all branches and only tags starting with 'config-test'.
* The `deploy` job runs for no branches and only tags starting with 'config-test'.

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  build-test-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build:
          filters:  # required since `test` has tag filters AND requires `build`
            tags:
              only: /^config-test.*/
      - test:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:  # required since `deploy` has tag filters AND requires `test`
            tags:
              only: /^config-test.*/
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^config-test.*/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
----

In the example below, two jobs are defined (`test` and `deploy`) and three workflows utilize those jobs:

* The `build` workflow runs for all branches except `main` and is not run on tags.
* The `staging` workflow will only run on the `main` branch and is not run on tags.
* The `production` workflow runs for no branches and only for tags starting with `v.`.

[source,yaml]

  production: # This workflow will only run on tags (specifically starting with 'v.') and will not run on branches
    jobs:
      - test:
          filters: &filters-production # this yaml anchor is setting these values to "filters-production"
            branches:

            - test
          filters:
            <<: *filters-production # this is calling the previously set yaml anchor
----

NOTE: Webhook payloads are capped at 25 MB and for some events a maximum of 3 tags. If you push several tags at once, CircleCI may not receive all of them.

[#using-regular-expressions-to-filter-tags-and-branches]
=== Using regular expressions to filter tags and branches

CircleCI branch and tag filters support the Java variant of regex pattern matching. When writing filters, CircleCI matches exact regular expressions.

For example, `+only: /^config-test/+` only matches the `config-test` tag. To match all tags starting with `config-test`, use `+only: /^config-test.*/+` instead.

Using tags for semantic versioning is a common use case. To match patch versions 3-7 of a 2.1 release, you could write `+/^version-2\.1\.[3-7]/+`.

For full details on pattern-matching rules, see the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[java.util.regex documentation].

[#using-workspaces-to-share-data-between-jobs]
== Using workspaces to share data between jobs

Each workflow has an associated workspace which can be used to transfer files to downstream jobs as the workflow progresses. For further information on workspaces and their configuration see the xref:workspaces#[Using Workspaces to Share Data Between Jobs] doc.

[#rerunning-a-workflows-failed-jobs]
== Rerunning a workflow's failed jobs

When you use workflows, you increase your ability to rapidly respond to failures. To rerun only a workflow's *failed* jobs, click the *Workflows* icon in the app and select a workflow to see the status of each job, then click the *Rerun* button and select *Rerun from failed*.

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/rerun-from-failed.png[CircleCI Workflows Page]

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

This section describes common problems and solutions for workflows.

[#workflow-and-subsequent-jobs-do-not-trigger]
=== Workflow and subsequent jobs do not trigger

If you do not see your workflows triggering, a common cause is a configuration error
preventing the workflow from starting. As a result, the workflow does not start
any jobs. Navigate to your project's pipelines and click on your workflow name
to discern what might be failing.

[#rerunning-workflows-fails]
=== Rerunning workflows fails

In some cases, a failure may happen before the workflow runs (during pipeline processing). Re-running the workflow will fail even though it was succeeding before the outage. To work around this, push a change to the project's repository. This will re-run pipeline processing first, and then run the workflow.

Also, please note that you cannot re-run jobs and workflows that are 90 days or older.

[#workflows-waiting-for-status-in-github]
=== Workflows waiting for status in GitHub

If you have implemented Workflows on a branch in your GitHub repository, but the status check never completes, there may be status settings in GitHub that you need to deselect. For example, if you choose to protect your branches, you may need to deselect the `ci/circleci` status key as this check refers to the default CircleCI 1.0 check, as follows:

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/github_branches_status.png[Uncheck GitHub Status Keys]

Having the `ci/circleci` checkbox enabled will prevent the status from showing as completed in GitHub when using a workflow because CircleCI posts statuses to GitHub with a key that includes the job by name.

Go to menu:Settings[Branches] in GitHub and click btn:[Edit] on the protected branch to deselect the settings, for example: `\https://github.com/your-org/project/settings/branches`.
