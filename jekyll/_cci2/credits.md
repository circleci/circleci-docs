This document describes the basics of using credits with CircleCI. If you are on the legacy CircleCI Container-based plan you may want to consider consulting the document on [using containers]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/containers). If you want to switch from using containers to using credits, please [open a support ticket](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) requesting so.

## Overview
{: #overview }

The CircleCI credit-based usage plans enable you to only pay for what you use, while also providing flexibility in customizing and scaling your team's CI solution. Credits are consumed by the second at varying rates according to what build configuration you use.

The right plan for you and your team will depend on several factors:

- How many users are on your team
- How much support you need (community support, standard support, or premium support)
- If you want access to different machine-types
- If you need features such as Docker Layer Caching, concurrent builds, or build history

Let's look at how a Performance plan might use credits. In this example, your team is divided into several groups working on different projects; some projects are larger while others are smaller and need less resources from a CI configuration. With credits it's possible to specify exactly where and when you need to maximize machine resources.

For example, your team might use a `large` `resource_class` (4 vCPUs and 8gb of memory) and make use of more credits/minute to speed up a build for a bigger project, while only using the `small` `resource_class` (1 vCPU, 2gb Memory) with less credits/minute for a smaller project that may not ship code as frequently, or where build time is inconsequential.

Consider taking a moment to look at the CircleCI [Pricing](https://circleci.com/pricing/) page to learn about what each CircleCI plan offers and how credits are distributed across different machine types.

## Configuring your credit plan
{: #configuring-your-credit-plan }

To set up your desired plan, go to `Settings > Plan Overview` in the CircleCI web application. From there, select the plan that best fits your needs.

## Free plan
{: #free-plan }

As with the CircleCI legacy Container plan, CircleCI also supports a free-tier with the usage-based plan. You can still make use of many key features offered by CircleCI:

- Using Orbs
- Workspaces
- Dependency Caching
- Windows/Linux builds

The free usage-based plan offers a set amount of build credits across medium-type machines per week (which offers 2 CPUs, 4gb of memory). With this combination, a small number of credits are charged per minute and there is no limit on user seats. Refer to the [Pricing](https://circleci.com/pricing/) page for more information on credit amounts.

## Performance plan
{: #performance-plan }

Upgrading to a Performance plan offers several improvements over the Free plan:

- Access to all machine sizes for Docker/Linux based machines
- Access to medium sized MacOS machines
- Scalable user seat count
- Access to Docker Layer Caching
- No queuing
- Support

## Open source credit usage
{: #open-source-credit-usage }

Organizations on our Free plan receive a set amount of free credits per month for Linux open source builds. Using our Free plan and keeping your repository public will enable this for you.  Open-source credit availability and limits will not be visible in the UI.

If you build on macOS, we also offer organizations on our Free plan a number of free credits every month to use on macOS open source builds. For access to this, contact our team at billing@circleci.com.

## Docker layer caching
{: #docker-layer-caching }

You are able to use credits per run job for Docker Layer Caching (DLC). DLC is only available on the Performance plan. Read more about DLC in this [document]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/docker-layer-caching).

## Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting }

### Am I charged if my build is "queued" or "preparing"?
{: #am-i-charged-if-my-build-is-queued-or-preparing }

No. If you are notified that a job is "queued", it indicates that your job is
waiting due to a **plan** or **concurrency** limit. If your job indicates that
it is "preparing", it means that CircleCI is setting up or _dispatching_ your
job so that it may run.

If you find that jobs are "preparing" for quite some time, you may be able to
reduce it if your jobs use the docker executor; try using more recent docker
images to decrease preparation time.
