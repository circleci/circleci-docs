= Using dynamic configuration
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:
:icons: font
:experimental:

This page covers some dynamic configuration examples. The following examples are provided below:

- <<a-basic-example>>: In this example, a script is used to generate a YAML configuration file. The continuation orb is used to continue the pipeline using the generated configuration.
- <<execute-specific-workflows-or-steps-based-on-which-files-are-modified>>: In this example, two configuration files are used, a setup configuration and a continuation configuration. The path filtering orb is used to conditionally set pipeline parameters, and conditional workflow logic is used to generate and continue the pipeline based on the location of modified files.
- <<generate-a-config-file-based-on-modified-files>>: In this example the continuation configuration is split into separate project-specific config files and a shared config file. Path filtering is used to generate a config file for continuation based on the location of modified files.
- <<pack-generate-validate>>:  In this example the continuation configuration is split into separate project-specific config files, and a shared config directory. Path filtering is used to pack, generate and validate a config file for continuation based on the location of modified files.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* The content on this page assumes you have already read the xref:dynamic-config#[Dynamic Configuration] page.
* If your project was created before December 1st 2023 you will need to enable dynamic configuration in your xref:dynamic-config#enable-dynamic-config[project settings].

[#a-basic-example]
== Continue a pipeline with a dynamically generated configuration file

The following is a basic example using CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.

In this example, we assume that a `generate-config` script already exists. The script outputs a new configuration YAML based on some type of work it performs, for example, inspecting `git` history or pipeline values that get passed to it, or anything else you might do from inside a xref:configuration-reference#jobs[`job`].

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

# define this file as the setup phase of your dynamic configuration
setup: true

# invoke the continuation orb to make the continuation/continue command available
orbs:
  continuation: circleci/continuation@1

jobs:
  setup:
    executor: continuation/default
    steps:
      - checkout # checkout code
      - run: # run command to run script to generate YAML config
          name: Generate config
          command: |
            ./generate-config > generated_config.yml
      - continuation/continue:
          configuration_path: generated_config.yml # use newly generated config to continue the pipeline

workflows:
  my-setup-workflow:
    jobs:
      - setup
----

* **Line 4**: Add the line `setup: true` to the top-level of our config, to designate it for use of CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.
* **Line 8**: Invoke the `continuation` orb so we can use it.
* **Lines 11-20**: Define a job called `setup` that uses the default xref:executor-intro#[`executor`] provided by the `continuation` orb as an . This job:
** Calls the xref:configuration-reference#checkout[`checkout`] step to checkout code from the configured repository.
** Calls the xref:configuration-reference#run[`run`] step to execute the existing `generate-config` script, so we can pass its output to the `continue` job of the `continuation` orb.
** Continues running the pipeline based on what configuration is provided to the required `configuration_path`.
* **Line 25**: We call the `setup` job defined above as a part of our `workflow`.

CAUTION: Only one workflow that includes a continuation is allowed per pipeline. To adhere to this you can either only configure a single continuation workflow, or you can use xref:configuration-reference#using-when-in-workflows[conditional logic] to ensure only one will run in a pipeline. This setup-workflow has access to a one-time-use token to create more workflows. The setup process does not cascade, therefore subsequent workflows in the pipeline cannot launch their own continuations.

For a more in-depth explanation of what the `continuation` orb does, review the orb's source code in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation?version=0.1.2[CircleCI developer hub].

[#execute-specific-workflows-or-steps-based-on-which-files-are-modified]
== Execute specific `workflows` or `steps` based on which files are modified

Your project may benefit from the ability to conditionally run some configuration based upon changes made to a specific set of files. Dynamically deciding the work to do in a pipeline based on the location of changes is beneficial when your code/microservices are stored in a monorepo, or a single repository. Without this ability, using _static_ configuration, each time a change is made to any file, all jobs and workflows would run even if they are unrelated to the actual change being made.

Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering[path filtering orb] to help simplify the process of using dynamic configuration based on the paths to modified files.

Consider a monorepo structure, as follows:

[source,shell]
----
.
├── .circleci
│   ├── config.yml
│   └── continue_config.yml
├── service1
│   ├── Service1.java
├── service2
│   ├── Service2.java
├── tests
│   ├── IntegrationTests.java
----

An example implementation of CircleCI's dynamic configuration for this structure is provided in the following `config.yml` and `continue_config.yml`.

[#config]
=== Setup configuration: `config.yml`

The `config.yml` file defines the initial setup phase of the dynamic configuration. In this example the path filtering orb is used to map file paths with pipeline parameter values. This means, if a change is made to a file matching a path regex, the corresponding parameter is set to the given value. These pipeline parameters are then passed to the continuation configuration and are used in the configured workflow conditional logic to determine which jobs should run.

The path filtering orb uses the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation[continuation orb] under the hood to continue the pipeline with the modified parameter values. The configuration used to continue the pipeline is described in the next section.

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

# define this file as the setup phase of your dynamic configuration
setup: true

# use the path-filtering orb to continue a pipeline based on
# the path of an updated set of files
orbs:
  path-filtering: circleci/path-filtering@1

workflows:
  always-run:
    jobs:
      # the path-filtering/filter job determines which pipeline
      # parameters to update.
      - path-filtering/filter:
          name: check-updated-files
          # 3-column, whitespace-delimited mapping. One mapping per
          # line:
          # <regex path-to-test> <parameter-to-set> <value-of-pipeline-parameter>
          mapping: |
            service1/.* run-build-service-1-job true
            service2/.* run-build-service-2-job true
          base-revision: main
          # this is the path of the configuration we should trigger once
          # path filtering and pipeline parameter value updates are
          # complete.
          config-path: .circleci/continue_config.yml # this is the default so not actually required but left in to illustrate options
----

[#continueconfig]
=== Continuation configuration: `continue_config.yml`

In this example, `continue_config.yml` is the _continuation configuration_, which means it is run once the initial `config.yml` finishes executing the `path-filtering/filter` job. The continuation configuration takes the updated pipeline parameter values, which were modified based on the paths to any changes in a commit, and uses them to conditionally run workflows using the `when` key. For more information on using `when` in workflows, see the xref:configuration-reference#using-when-in-workflows[Configuration reference].

* Define three separate workflows to be conditionally executed based on the pipeline parameter values:
** **Lines 22-28**: The `service-1` workflow triggers the `maven/test` job on the `service-1` directory, when the pipeline parameter value mapped to run-build-service-1-job is set to `true`. This will only happen if a change was made in the `serivce-1` directory in the commit, as determined based on the path filtering in the setup phase (`config.yml`).
** **Lines 31-37**: The `service-2` workflow triggers the `maven/test` job on the `service-2` directory, when the pipeline parameter value mapped to run-build-service-2-job is set to `true`. This will only happen if a change was made in the `serivce-2` directory in the commit, as determined based on the path filtering in the setup phase (`config.yml`).
** **Lines 43-50**: The `run-integration-tests` workflow will run if the `run-build-service-1-job` or `run-build-service-2-job` pipeline parameters have been updated to `true` based on the results of the path filtering. This runs the `maven/test` job on the `tests` directory to run integration tests against the built services.

[#generate-a-config-file-based-on-modified-files]
== Generate a configuration file based on modified files

TIP: This project is available on link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/dynamic-configuration-examples/tree/generate-config-file-main[GitHub] and you can see it building on link:https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/dynamic-configuration-examples?branch=generate-config-file-main[CircleCI].

For this example, consider a project that includes:

* Separate directories for code (`src/`) and docs (`docs/`).
* A setup configuration, `config.yml`.
* Separate configuration files for building the code and the docs, `code-config.yml` and `docs-config.yml`.
* A `shared-config.yml` file that defines shared jobs to be used when building the code and the docs.
* A `no-updates.yml` config file to be used in the event that a pipeline is triggered with no changes.

Each configuration file is explained in the following sections.

[#setup-config-1]
=== Setup configuration

In this example, the setup configuration includes a single job referenced from the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering#jobs-filter[path filtering orb], which is used to map pipeline parameter values and configuration files with paths to specific locations in the repository.

Under the hood the following steps are taken when the pipeline is triggered:

* A script runs to check for modified files in a commit against a base branch (in this example, the default, `generate-config-file-main`).
* A continuation configuration is generated using the relevant config files from the project, and the pipeline parameter values are set.
* The pipeline is continued using the continuation configuration.

[#shared-configuration-1]
=== Shared configuration

In the event of changes to _any_ file in the repository (`.*`) the `shared-config.yml` configuration is included in the continuation configuration. The only time `shared-config.yml` will not be used is on a commit that contains no changes.

NOTE: `shared-config.yml` is designed to be used either on its own or along with other partial configurations. You can include anything that should _always_ run in the shared configuration.. `code-config.yml` or `docs-config.yml` include workflows that orchestrate the shared jobs defined in `shared-config.yml` and they can be combined together to create the required pipeline for a set of changes.

[#directory-specific-config-1]
=== Directory-specific configuration

The config files for building the separate directories, `src/` and `/docs`, contain build jobs for the content and workflows to orchestrate the build and shared jobs described above. The `lint` job is used for both, and the `test` job is only used when the code is built, not the docs.

[#config-no-change-1]
=== Configuration for no change

We have used the path filtering orb to map configuration files with file paths so we know which configuration will be used when a change is made in a specific location. If a pipeline is triggered with no changes in any of our defined paths, CircleCI needs to know what to do next.

One way to handle this scenario is to provide an alternative configuration using the `config-path` parameter (see line 27 <<setup-config-1,here>>). `config-path` is ignored if a mapping is in place, but will be used if no mapping matches the path to modified files. In this example, we use a `no-updates.yml` configuration file. Another option would be to configure a step using the `finish` command from the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation#commands-finish[continuation orb].

* A setup configuration, `config.yml`.
* Separate configuration files for building the code and the docs, `code-config.yml` and `docs-config.yml`.
* A `shared/` configuration directory containing our shared jobs in separate YAML files. This is used to generate `shared-config.yml` using the xref:how-to-use-the-circleci-local-cli#packing-a-config[CircleCI CLI command] `circleci config pack`
* A `no-updates.yml` config file to be used in the event that there are no changes.

[#setup-config-2]
=== Setup configuration

The setup configuration had a single job, `setup`, which has the following steps:

* Checkout code
* Install the CircleCI CLI
* Generate a shared configuration file
* Map file paths with pipeline parameter values and configuration files, using the path filtering orb
* Generate a configuration file to fit the changes included in the commit that triggered the pipeline
* Validate the configuration file using the CLI
* Continue the pipeline with the new configuration file using the continuation orb

[#shared-configuration]
=== Shared configuration

In this example, shared configuration elements are stored in individual YAML files using a directory structure compatible with the `circleci config pack` command.

Jobs are stored in a `jobs` folder, workflows stored in a `workflows` folder, and so on. These files can be used in the setup stage of our dynamic configuration to generate a shared configuration by "packing" the relevant components together.

TIP: When packing a config using `circleci config pack`, the component names are not included in the configuration files, they are taken from the file names.
