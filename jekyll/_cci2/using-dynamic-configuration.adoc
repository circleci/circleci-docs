This section assumes you have already read the xref:dynamic-config#[Dynamic Configuration] page and
have followed the steps outlined in the xref:dynamic-config#getting-started-with-dynamic-config-in-circleci[Getting Started with Dynamic Configuration] section.

The following examples of dynamic configuration usage are provided below:

- <<a-basic-example>>
- <<execute-specific-workflows-or-steps-based-on-which-files-are-modified>>

[#a-basic-example]
== A basic example

The following is a basic example using CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.

In this example, we assume that a `generate-config` script already exists. The script outputs a new configuration YAML based on some type of work it performs. 

It could potentially inspect `git` history, pipeline values that get passed to it, or anything else you might do from inside a xref:configuration-reference#jobs[`job`].

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

# this allows you to use CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature
setup: true

# the continuation orb is required in order to use dynamic configuration
orbs:
  continuation: circleci/continuation@0.1.2

# our defined job, and its steps
jobs:
  setup:
    executor: continuation/default
    steps:
      - checkout # checkout code
      - run: # run a command
          name: Generate config
          command: |
            ./generate-config > generated_config.yml
      - continuation/continue:
          configuration_path: generated_config.yml # use newly generated config to continue

# our single workflow, that triggers the setup job defined above
workflows:
  setup:
    jobs:
      - setup
----

In the above configuration, we:

- Add the line `setup: true` to the top-level of our config, to designate it for use of CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.
- Invoke the `continuation` orb so we can use it.
- Define a job called `setup` that uses the `continuation` orb as an xref:executor-intro#[`executor`]. This job:
    - Calls the xref:configuration-reference#checkout[`checkout`] step to checkout code from the configured repository.
    - Calls the xref:configuration-reference#run[`run`] step to execute the existing `generate-config` script, so we can pass its output to the `continue` job of the `continuation` orb.
    - Continues running the pipeline based on what configuration is provided to the required `configuration_path`.
- Lastly, we call the `setup` job defined above as a part of our `workflow`.

CAUTION: You can only use one workflow per `config.yml` when using CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.
You can only run a single workflow as part of the pipeline's setup stage. This setup-workflow has access to a one-time-use token to create more workflows. The setup process does not cascade, so subsequent workflows in the pipeline cannot launch their own continuations.

For a more in-depth explanation of what the `continuation` orb does, review the orb's source code in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation?version=0.1.2[CircleCI Developer Hub] or review the xref:dynamic-config#dynamic-config-faqs[Dynamic configuration FAQ].

[#execute-specific-workflows-or-steps-based-on-which-files-are-modified]
== Execute specific `workflows` or `steps` based on which files are modified

You may find that you would like to conditionally run a `workflow` or `step` based upon changes made to a specific fileset. This would be beneficial in the case of your code/microservices being stored in a monorepo, or a single repository.

To achieve this, CircleCI has provided the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering[`path-filtering`] orb, which allows a pipeline to continue execution based upon the specific paths of updated files.

For example, consider a monorepo structure like the example shown below:

[source,shell]
----
.
├── .circleci
│   ├── config.yml
│   └── continue_config.yml
├── service1
│   ├── Service1.java
├── service2
│   ├── Service2.java
├── tests
│   ├── IntegrationTests.java
----

An example implementation of CircleCI's dynamic configuration for the above use case can be found in the following `config.yml` and `continue_config.yml`:

[source,yaml]

version: 2.1

# this allows you to use CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature

# the path-filtering orb is required to continue a pipeline based on
# the path of an updated fileset
orbs:
  path-filtering: circleci/path-filtering@0.1.1

workflows:
  # the always-run workflow is always triggered, regardless of the pipeline parameters.
  always-run:
    jobs:
      # the path-filtering/filter job determines which pipeline
      # parameters to update.
      - path-filtering/filter:
          name: check-updated-files
          # 3-column, whitespace-delimited mapping. One mapping per
          # line:
          # <regex path-to-test> <parameter-to-set> <value-of-pipeline-parameter>
          mapping: |
            service1/.* run-build-service-1-job true
            service2/.* run-build-service-2-job true
          base-revision: main
          # this is the path of the configuration we should trigger once
          # path filtering and pipeline parameter value updates are
          # complete. In this case, we are using the parent dynamic
          # configuration itself.
          config-path: .circleci/continue_config.yml

----

In the above configuration, we:

* Add the line `setup: true` to the top-level of our config, to designate it for use of CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature.
* Invoke the `path-filtering` and `maven` orbs so we can use them.
* Define two boolean pipeline parameters, `run-build-service-1-job` and `run-build-service-2-job`
* Define four jobs: `check-updated-files`, `build-service-1`, `build-service-2`, and `run-integration-tests`:
** The `check-updated-files` job will use the `path-filtering` orb to determine which files have changed, according to
    the file-path provided. It will also set the designated pipeline parameters to their specified values (in this case, different maven commands will be triggered based on which files changed).
** The `build-service-1` job uses the `maven` orb to compile/install the service1 code, but skips any tests
** The `build-service-2` job uses the `maven` orb to compile/install the service2 code, but skips any tests
** The `run-integration-tests` job uses the `maven` orb to run any integration tests
* Define four workflows, three of which are conditionally executed:
** The `service-1` workflow triggers the `build-service-1` job when the pipeline parameter value mapped to run-build-service-1-job is set to `true`
** The `service-2` workflow triggers the `build-service-2` job when the pipeline parameter value mapped to run-build-service-2-job is set to `true`
** The `run-integration-tests` workflow will run if the `run-build-service-1-job` or `run-build-service-2-job` pipeline parameters have been updated to `true` based on the results of the `path-filtering` orb
** The `check-updated-files` workflow will always run any time this pipeline is triggered

information on available elements and required parameters.
