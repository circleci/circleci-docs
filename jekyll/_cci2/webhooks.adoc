Use <<inbound-webhooks>> to trigger a pipeline from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command. Inbound webhooks are available for accounts integrated through the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App].

Use <<outbound-webhooks>> to:

* Build a custom dashboard to visualize or analyze workflow/job events.
* Send data to incident management tools (such as link:https://www.pagerduty.com[PagerDuty]).
* Use tools like xref:webhooks-airtable#[Airtable] to capture data and visualize it.
* Alert when a workflow is cancelled, then use the API to rerun the workflow.
* Trigger notification systems to alert people when workflows/jobs complete.
* Build your own automation plugins and tools.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

A webhook allows you to connect a platform (for example, CircleCI, an API you create yourself, or a third party service) to a stream of future _events_.

Setting up an **outbound webhook** on CircleCI enables your third party service to receive information (referred to as _events_) from CircleCI, as they happen. This can help you avoid polling the API or manually checking the CircleCI web application for desired information.

Setting up an **inbound webhook** on CircleCI enables a third party service to trigger a CircleCI pipeline. Any service that can send a webhook or make a `curl` request can trigger a CircleCI pipeline.

NOTE: Selecting an inbound webhook as a pipeline trigger is currently in **open preview**. This feature is only available for accounts that are integrated through the CircleCI GitHub App. To find out which GitHub account type you have, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

== Inbound webhooks

Use **inbound webhooks** to trigger a pipeline from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command. This section presents some use cases for CircleCI inbound webhooks.

=== Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up and test an inbound webhook trigger. Trigger from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command:

{% include snippets/inbound-webhook-setup.adoc %}

. You can now test your inbound webhook trigger with `curl`. To trigger your pipeline, copy and paste the following sample request and replace `<your-URL>` and `<your-secret>` with the URL and secret that you generated in the previous step:
+
NOTE: When triggering via `curl`, you must use a `POST` request with `content-type: application/json`.
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" 'https://internal.circleci.com/private/soc/e/<your-URL>?secret=<your-secret>'
----

See our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-pipelines-from-anywhere-inbound-webhooks-now-in-preview/49864[community forum] for more details or how to use this functionality with a link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/re-build-automatically-when-new-image-is-available-on-dockerhub/50350[3rd party service like DockerHub].

=== Example: Trigger one pipeline from another

Use an inbound webhook to configure one pipeline to trigger a second pipeline. For example, you might need to run a set of integration tests on a repository after you have made a change to a separate repository.

For this example, assume you have two projects in separate repositories:

TIP: You can also use this method to trigger one pipeline from another within the _same_ project.

* Project A
* Project B

When a change is made to Project A, we want the full Project A configuration to be run, and then the Project B pipeline should be triggered. To achieve this, follow these steps:

==== 1. Set up an inbound webhook for Project B

Navigate to Project B in the CircleCI web app and set up an inbound webhook by following these steps:

{% include snippets/inbound-webhook-setup.adoc %}

==== 2. Configure Project A to trigger Project B

Navigate to Project A in the CircleCI web app and set up an environment variable. The value of the environment variable will be the secret from the inbound webhook you just set up for Project B.

TIP: As an alternative, you can add an environment variable using a xref:contexts#[context].

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select your organization.
. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]), and select **Project Settings**.
. Select **Environment Variables** from the sidebar.
. Select btn:[Add Environment Variable].
. Give your environment variable a name, for example, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
. Update your Project A configuration file with a step that will trigger a pipeline for Project B, for example (lines 13-16):
+

=== Example: Extract inbound webhook payload data

The inbound webhook body is available by using the `pipeline.trigger_parameters.webhook.body` xref:variables#pipeline-values[pipeline value].

The following example shows how you can use `jq` to extract values from the webhook payload into environment variables when you want to use them in your configuration.

In this example the webhook body contains a property called `branch`. `jq` is installed and used to extract the `branch` value into an environment variable names `WEBHOOK_BRANCH`, which is then used in a GitHub clone command.

TIP: The xref:configuration-reference#commands[command] configured in this example uses commands from the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/jq[jq] and link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/github-cli[GitHub CLI] orbs.

      - gh/setup:
          token: "GITHUB_TOKEN_ALACRITY_BOT"
      - jq/install
      - run:
          name: Shallow Clone
          environment:
            WEBHOOK_BRANCH: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.webhook.body >> | jq .branch
          command: gh repo clone << pipeline.trigger_parameters.github_app.repo_url >> . -- --depth 10 --branch "$WEBHOOK_BRANCH"

== Outbound webhooks

Use outbound webhooks to integrate your CircleCI builds with external services. The following sections detail CircleCI outbound webhook structure and protocols.

=== Quickstart

NOTE: Projects are limited to 5 outbound webhooks.

Webhooks are set up on a per-project basis, either within the CircleCI app or via API.

To configure webhooks via API see our documentation for https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Webhook[Webhooks Public API].

To configure webhooks within the CircleCI app:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select your organization.
. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]), and select **Project Settings**.
. In the sidebar select *Webhooks*
. Select *Add Webhook*
. Fill out the webhook form (the table below describes the fields and their intent)
. If your receiving API or third party service is set up, select *Test Ping Event* to send a test event.
+
NOTE: The test ping event has an abbreviated payload for ease of testing. See full examples for xref:webhooks#workflow-completed[workflow-completed] and xref:webhooks#job-completed[job-completed] events below.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field | Required? | Intent

| Webhook name
| Y
| The name of your webhook

| URL
| Y
| The URL the webhook will make POST requests to

| Certificate Validation
| Y
| Ensure the receiving host has a valid SSL certificate before sending an event. You should only leave this unchecked for testing purposes.

| Secret token
| N
| Used by your API/platform to validate incoming data is from CircleCI

| Select an event
| Y
| You must select at least one event that will trigger a webhook
|===

[#communication-protocol]
=== Communication protocol for outbound webhooks

Once set up, a webhook is sent whenever an event occurs on the CircleCI platform.

A webhook is sent using an HTTP POST to the URL that was registered when the webhook was created, with a body encoded using JSON.

CircleCI expects the server that responds to a webhook will return a 2xx response code. If a non-2xx response is received, CircleCI will retry at a later time. If CircleCI does not receive a response to the webhook within a short period of time, CircleCI will assume that delivery has failed, and will retry at a later time. The timeout period is currently 5 seconds.

Webhook requests may be duplicated. To deduplicate (prevent requests from being duplicated for a specific event), use the xref:webhooks-reference#common-top-level-keys[`id` property] in the webhook payload for identification.

If you have feedback about timeouts and retries, link:https://circleci.canny.io/webhooks[get in touch] with our team.

[#headers]
==== Outbound webhook headers

A number of HTTP headers are set on webhooks, as detailed in the table below.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Header name | Value

| `content-type`
| `application/json`

| `user-agent`
| A string indicating that the sender was CircleCI (`CircleCI-Webhook/1.0`).

| `circleci-event-type`
| The type of event, (`workflow-completed`, `job-completed`, etc)

| `circleci-signature`
| When present, this signature can be used to verify that the sender of the webhook has access to the secret token.
|===

[#validate-webhooks]
=== Validate outbound webhooks

You should validate webhooks as they come in to third party services to verify that they are coming from CircleCI. To support this, when creating a webhook, you can optionally provide a secret token. Each outgoing HTTP request to your service will contain a `circleci-signature` header. This header will consist of a comma-separated list of versioned signatures.

[,shell]
----
POST /uri HTTP/1.1
Host: your-webhook-host
circleci-signature: v1=4fcc06915b43d8a49aff193441e9e18654e6a27c2c428b02e8fcc41ccc2299f9,v2=...,v3=...
----

Currently, the latest (and only) signature version is v1. You should _only_ check the latest signature type to prevent downgrade attacks.

The v1 signature is the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body, using the configured signing secret as the secret key.

Here are some example signatures for given request bodies:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Body | Secret Key | Signature

| `hello world`
| `secret`
| `734cc62f32841568f45715aeb9f4d7891324e6d948e4c6c60c0621cdac48623a`

| `lalala`
| `another-secret`
| `daa220016c8f29a8b214fbfc3671aeec2145cfb1e6790184ffb38b6d0425fa00`

| `an-important-request-payload`
| `hunter123`
| `9be2242094a9a8c00c64306f382a7f9d691de910b4a266f67bd314ef18ac49fa`
|===

The following is an example of how you might validate signatures in Python:

[,python]
----
import hmac

def verify_signature(secret, headers, body):
    # get the v1 signature from the `circleci-signature` header
    signature_from_header = {
        k: v for k, v in [
            pair.split('=') for pair in headers['circleci-signature'].split(',')
        ]
    }['v1']

    # Run HMAC-SHA256 on the request body using the configured signing secret
    valid_signature = hmac.new(bytes(secret, 'utf-8'), bytes(body, 'utf-8'), 'sha256').hexdigest()

    # use constant time string comparison to prevent timing attacks
    return hmac.compare_digest(valid_signature, signature_from_header)

# the following will return `True`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=773ba44693c7553d6ee20f61ea5d2757a9a4f4a44d2841ae4e95b52e4cd62db4'
    },
    'foo',
)

# the following will return `False`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=not-a-valid-signature'
    },
    'foo',
)
----
