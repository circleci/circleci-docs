== Steps to rename organizations and repositories

. Rename organization or repository in your VCS
. Go to the CircleCI web app using the new org/repo name, for example: `app.circleci.com/pipelines/<VCS>/<new-org-name>/<project-name>`
. Confirm that your plan, projects, and settings have been transferred successfully
. If desired, you are now free to create a new org/repo with the previously-used name in your VCS
