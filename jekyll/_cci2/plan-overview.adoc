This document is an introduction to the plans CircleCI offers to developers. 

NOTE: If you are an existing customer currently on the legacy CircleCI Container-based plan, you may want to consider consulting the document on using <<containers#,containers>>. If you want to switch from using containers to using credits, please https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[open a support ticket] requesting to do so.

[#overview]
== Overview
The CircleCI credit-based usage plans enable you to only pay for what you use, while also providing flexibility in customizing and scaling your team's https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/#what-is-continuous-integration[CI/CD] solution. Credits are consumed by the second, at varying rates per minute, according to what build configuration you use.

The right plan for you and your team will depend on several factors:

- How many users are on your team
- How much support you need (community and free support, standard support, or premium support)
- If you want access to different machine-types and resource classes
- If you want a limited or unlimited number of self-hosted runners

Let's look at how a team might use credits. In this example, your team is divided into several groups working on different projects. Some projects are larger while others are smaller and need less resources from a CI/CD configuration. With credits, it is possible to specify exactly where and when you need to maximize machine resources.

For example, your team might use a `large` `resource_class` (4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory) and make use of more credits/minute to speed up a build for a bigger project, while only using the `small` `resource_class` (1 CPU, 2 GB memory) with less credits/minute for a smaller project that may not ship code as frequently, or where build time is inconsequential.

The documents in this section cover what each plan offers developers for their CI/CD needs. Consider also taking a moment to look at the CircleCI https://circleci.com/pricing/[Pricing] page to learn about how credits are distributed across different machine types.

[#configuring-your-credit-plan]
== Configuring your credit plan
To set up a Free or Performance plan, go to **Plan > Plan Overview** in the CircleCI https://app.circleci.com/[web application]. From there, select the plan that best fits your needs. To set up a Scale or Server plan, https://circleci.com/talk-to-us/[contact us].

[#managing-credit-usage]
== Managing credit usage
There are certain optimizations that can be implemented that can help lower your credit consumption, such as eliminating duplicate artifact uploads. Properly managing network and storage usage can potentially lower the amount of credits used per month. If you would like to find out more about managing network and storage usage, please see the <<persist-data#,Persisting Data>> page.
