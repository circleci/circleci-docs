## Skipping a build

By default, CircleCI automatically builds a project whenever you push changes to a version control system (VCS). You can override this behavior by adding a `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` tag in the first line of the body of the commit or the commit's title. This not only skips the marked commit, but also **all other commits** in the push.

**Note:**
This feature is not supported for fork PRs. Scheduled workflows will not be cancelled even if you push a commit with `[ci skip]` message. Changing the config file is the way to upgrade the current schedule.

    fix misspelling [ci skip]
```

When pushed to a VCS, this commit will not be built on CircleCI because of the `[ci skip]` in the commit title.

    A large feature with squashed commits

    [skip ci] Fix bug in feature
    Refactor feature code
    First attempt at feature
```

When pushed to a VCS, this commit will not be built on CircleCI because of the `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` in the commit description.

**Note:**
If you push multiple commits at once, a single `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` will skip the build **for all commits**.

## Auto cancelling a redundant build

If you are frequently pushing changes to a branch, you increase the chances of queueing. This means you might have to wait for an older pipeline to finish building before the most recent version starts.

To save time, you can configure CircleCI to automatically cancel any queued or running pipelines when a newer pipeline is triggered on that same branch.

**Note:** Your project's default branch (usually `master`) will never auto-cancel builds. 

### Steps to enable auto-cancel for pipelines triggered by pushes to GitHub or the API
{:.no_toc}

**Notes:** It is important to carefully consider the impact of enabling the auto-cancel feature, for example, if you have configured automated deployment jobs on non-default branches.

1. In the CircleCI application, go to your Project Settings.

2. Click on **Advanced Settings**.

3. In the **Auto-cancel redundant builds** section, enable the feature by switching the toggle switch to the **On** position.

Projects for which auto-cancel is enabled in the Advanced Settings will have pipelines and workflows on non-default branches cancelled when a newer build is triggered on that same branch, with the following exceptions:
- Scheduled workflows and Re-run workflows will not be cancelled.

## Auto cancel for CircleCI server installations

CircleCI Server does not currently use the pipelines feature, and as a result the Auto Cancel Builds feature only works for builds triggered with the API or by pushes to GitHub for projects that **do not** use workflows.

### Steps to enable auto-cancel for CircleCI server installations

1. In the CircleCI application, go to your project's settings by clicking the gear icon next to your project.

2. In the **Build Settings** section, click on **Advanced Settings**.

3. In the **Auto-cancel redundant builds** section, click the **On** button.
