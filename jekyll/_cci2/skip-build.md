_[Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/basics/) > Skipping a Build_

By default,
CircleCI automatically builds a project
whenever you push changes to a version control system (VCS).
You can override this behavior
by adding a `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` tag
anywhere in a commit's title or description.
This not only skips the marked commit,
but also **all other commits** in the push.

If you later decide to build a skipped commit,
you can override any skip tags
by rerunning the build.
If you are using workflows,
go to the Workflows page of the CircleCI application
and rerun the entire Workflow or rerun it from failed jobs.
Otherwise, click one of the Rebuild options on the Build page of the CircleCI application.

**Note:**
This feature is not supported for fork PRs.

When pushed to a VCS,
this commit will not be built on CircleCI
because of the `[ci skip]` in the commit title.

## Example Commit Description

    A large feature with squashed commits

    Fix bug in feature
    Refactor feature code
    First attempt at feature [ci skip]
```

When pushed to a VCS,
this commit will not be built on CircleCI
because of the `[ci skip]` in the commit description.

**Note:**
If you push multiple commits at once,
a single `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` will skip the build **for all commits**.
