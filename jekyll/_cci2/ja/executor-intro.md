Set up your build environment to run with the `docker`, `machine`, or `macos` executor and specify an image with only the tools and packages you need.

## Docker

    jobs:
      build: # name of your job
        docker: # executor type
          - image: buildpack-deps:trusty # primary container will run Ubuntu Trusty
    

## Machine

    jobs:
      build: 
        machine: 
          image: circleci/classic:201708-01 # VM will run Ubuntu 14.04 for this release date
    

## macOS

    jobs:
      build:
        macos:
          xcode: "9.0"
    
        steps:
          # Commands will execute in macOS container
          # with Xcode 9.0 installed
          - run: xcodebuild -version
