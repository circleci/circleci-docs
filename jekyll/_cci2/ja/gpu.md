This document outlines how to run GPU (graphics processing unit) machine executors using CircleCI Server.

* TOC {:toc}

## Prerequisites

Configure the `vm-service` in the Replicated management console to start a GPU-enabled instance.

## Overview

Run the following commands on any Nvidia GPU-enabled instance. The following example uses CUDA 8.0, but you can use any CUDA runtime version supported by your GPU instance.

1. `wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/prod/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-8-0-local_8.0.44-1_amd64-deb` 
2. `sudo apt-get update`
3. `export OS_RELEASE=$(uname -r)`
4. `sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-extra-$OS_RELEASE linux-headers-$OS_RELEASE linux-image-$OS_RELEASE`
5. `sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-8-0-local_8.0.44-1_amd64-deb`
6. `sudo apt-get update`
7. `sudo apt-get --yes --force-yes install cuda`
8. `nvidia-smi`

Step 8 is only required for testing purposes. After you install the CUDA driver in Step 7 you should be good to go!

## Adding GPU Steps to an AMI

To avoid start up time associated with the above steps, they may be included in an AMI by following the instructions in the [Configuring VM Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/vm-service) documentation.
