- TOC {:toc}

## Overview

{:.no_toc}

CircleCI offers support for building and testing iOS and macOS projects. Refer to the manifest of the software installed on CircleCI macOS build images in the Using a macOS Build Image document.

## Supported Xcode Versions

The currently available Xcode versions are:

- `10.0.0`: Xcode 10.0 (Build 10A254a) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-449/index.html)
- `9.4.1`: Xcode 9.4.1 (Build 9F2000) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-430/index.html)
- `9.4.0`: Xcode 9.4 (Build 9F1027a) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-422/index.html)
- `9.3.1`: Xcode 9.3.1 (Build 9E501) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-419/index.html)
- `9.3.0`: Xcode 9.3 (Build 9E145) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-405/index.html)

- `8.3.3`: Xcode 8.3.3 (Build 8E3004b) [installed software](https://circle-macos-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/image-manifest/build-146/index.html)

## Getting Started

Select a macOS project you would like to build on the Add Projects page of the CircleCI application. **Note:** Changing build environment is no longer needed in 2.0. If your project is not listed as macOS, choose Linux project and then select macOS in the Operating System section.

## Basic Setup

After enabling macOS builds for your project, share the scheme that is going to be built on CircleCI so that CircleCI runs the correct build actions. Complete the following steps to share an existing scheme in Xcode:

1. Choose Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes.
2. Select the Shared option for the scheme to share, and click Close.
3. Choose Source Control > Commit.
4. Select the Shared Data folder.
5. Enter your commit message in the text field.
6. Select the "Push to remote" option (if your project is managed with Git).
7. Click the Commit Files button. A new `.xcscheme` file is located in the `xcshareddata/xcschemes` folder under your Xcode project.
8. Commit this file to your git repository so that CircleCI can access it.

Simple projects should run with minimal configuration. You can find an example of a minimal config in the [iOS Project Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/ios-tutorial/).

### Best Practices

{:.no_toc}

In addition to the basic setup steps, it is best practice to include downloading CocoaPods specs from the CircleCI mirror (up to 70% faster) and linting the Swift code together with the `build-and-test` job:

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    macos:
      xcode: "9.0"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output

    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Fetch CocoaPods Specs
          command: |
            curl https://cocoapods-specs.circleci.com/fetch-cocoapods-repo-from-s3.sh | bash -s cf
      - run:
          name: Install CocoaPods
          command: pod install --verbose

      - run:
          name: Build and run tests
          command: fastlane scan
          environment:
            SCAN_DEVICE: iPhone 8
            SCAN_SCHEME: WebTests

      - store_test_results:
          path: output/scan
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-test:
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
```

## Advanced Setup

For advanced setup, it is possible to run a lint job together with your build and test job, and potentially also run tools like [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger).

The recommended configuration can be extended to add a lint job and a Danger job as follows:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build-and-test:
  swiftlint:
    docker:
      - image: dantoml/swiftlint:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: swiftlint lint --reporter junit | tee result.xml
      - store_artifacts:
          path: result.xml
      - store_test_results:
          path: result.xml
  danger:
    docker:
      - image: dantoml/danger:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: danger

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-test-lint:
    jobs:
      - swiftlint
      - danger
      - build-and-test
```

## Using Fastlane

[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is a set of tools for automating the build and deploy process of mobile apps. We encourage the use of Fastlane on CircleCI as that allows for parity of build / deploy locally and on CircleCI, and simplifies the setup process.

### Adding a Gemfile

{:.no_toc}

It is recommended to add a `Gemfile` to your repository to make sure that the same version of Fastlane is used both locally and on CircleCI. The simplest `Gemfile` could look like this:

    # Gemfile
    source "https://rubygems.org"
    gem 'fastlane'
    

After you have created a `Gemfile` locally, you will need to run `bundle install` and check both `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` into your repository.

### Setting up Fastlane for use on CircleCI

{:.no_toc}

When using Fastlane in your CircleCI project, we recommend adding the following to your `Fastfile`:

    # fastlane/Fastfile
    
    ...
    platform :ios do
      before_all do
        setup_circle_ci
      end
      ...
    end
    

The `setup_circle_ci` Fastlane action must be in the `before_all` block to perform the following actions:

- Create a new temporary keychain for use with Fastlane Match (see the code signing section for more details).
- Switch Fastlane Match to `readonly` mode to make sure CI does not create new code signing certificates or provisioning profiles.
- Set up log and test result paths to be easily collectible.

### Example Configuration for Using Fastlane on CircleCI

{:.no_toc}

A basic Fastlane configuration that can be used on CircleCI is as follows:

    # fastlane/Fastfile
    default_platform :ios
    
    platform :ios do
      before_all do
        setup_circle_ci
      end
    
      desc "Runs all the tests"
      lane :test do
        scan
      end
    
      desc "Ad-hoc build"
      lane :adhoc do
        match(type: "adhoc")
        gym(export_method: "ad-hoc")
      end
    end
    

This configuration can be used with the following CircleCI config file:

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    macos:
      xcode: "9.0"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output
      FASTLANE_LANE: test
    shell: /bin/bash --login -o pipefail
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: bundle install
      - run:
          name: Fastlane
          command: bundle exec fastlane $FASTLANE_LANE
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output
      - store_test_results:
          path: output/scan

  adhoc:
    macos:
      xcode: "9.0"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output
      FASTLANE_LANE: adhoc
    shell: /bin/bash --login -o pipefail
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: bundle install
      - run:
          name: Fastlane
          command: bundle exec fastlane $FASTLANE_LANE
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-test-adhoc:
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      - adhoc:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: development
          requires:
            - build-and-test
```

### Using CocoaPods

{:.no_toc}

If you are using CocoaPods, then we recommend that you check your [Pods directory into source control](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control). This will ensure that you have a deterministic, reproducible build.

## Supported Build and Test Tools

In CircleCI 2.0 it is possible to customize your build as needed to satisfy almost any iOS build and test strategy.

### XCTest-based tools

{:.no_toc}

The following test tools are known to work well on CircleCI (though many others should work just fine):

- [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/01-introduction.html)
- [Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwi-bdd/Kiwi)
- [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF)

### Other Tools

{:.no_toc}

Popular iOS testing tools like [Appium](http://appium.io/) and [Frank](http://www.testingwithfrank.com/) should also work normally and are installed and called using `run` commands.

### Pre-Starting the Simulator

{:.no_toc}

Pre-start the iOS simulator before building your application to make sure that the simulator is booted in time. Doing so generally reduces the number of simulator timeouts observed in builds.

To pre-start the simulator, add the following to your `config.yml` file, assuming that you are running your tests on an iPhone 7 simulator with iOS 10.2:

        steps:
          - run:
              name: pre-start simulator
              command: xcrun instruments -w "iPhone 7 (10.2) [" || true
    

**Note:** the `[` character is necessary to uniquely identify the iPhone 7 simulator, as the phone + watch simulator is also present in the build image:

- `iPhone 7 (10.2) [<uuid>]` for the iPhone simulator.
- `iPhone 7 Plus (10.2) + Apple Watch Series 2 - 42mm (3.1) [<uuid>]` for the phone + watch pair.

### Creating a `config.yml` File

{:.no_toc}

The most flexible means to customize your build is to add a `.circleci/config.yml` file to your project, which allows you to run arbitrary bash commands at various points in the build process. See the [Configuring CircleCI]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) document for a detailed discussion of the structure of the `config.yml` file. **Note:** A number of options in the document will not work for macOS builds.

### Installing Custom Packages

{:.no_toc}

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is pre-installed on CircleCI, so you can simply use `brew install` to add nearly any dependency required in your build VM. Here's an example:

        steps:
          - run:
              name: Install cowsay
              command: brew install cowsay
          - run:
              name: cowsay hi
              command: cowsay Hi!
    

It is also possible to use the `sudo` command if necessary to perform customizations outside of Homebrew.

### Using Custom Ruby Versions

{:.no_toc}

The macOS container ships with the system-installed Ruby, as well as the latest stable versions of Ruby as provided by [Ruby-Lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). To allow you to manage custom versions of Ruby, we install [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby). To select a custom version of ruby you should [create a file named `.ruby-version` and commit it to your repository, as documented by `chruby`](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#auto-switching). You will also need to change the default shell that commands are executed with to be a login shell, so that `chruby` is correctly invoked.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    macos:
      xcode: "9.0"
    shell: /bin/bash --login -eo pipefail
```

If you do not want to commit a `.ruby-version` file to source control, then you can create the file from a job step:

```yaml
run:
  name: Set Ruby Version
  command:  echo "ruby-2.4" > ~/.ruby-version
```

### Using Custom Versions of CocoaPods and Other Ruby Gems

{:.no_toc}

To make sure the version of CocoaPods that you use locally is also used in your CircleCI builds, we suggest creating a Gemfile in your iOS project and adding the CocoaPods version to it:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    
    gem 'cocoapods', '= 1.3.0'
    

Then you can install these using bundler:

{% raw %}

        steps:
          - restore_cache:
              key: 1-gems-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
    
          - run: bundle check || bundle install --path vendor/bundle
    
          - save_cache:
              key: 1-gems-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
              paths:
                - vendor/bundle
    

{% endraw %}

You can then ensure you are using those, by prefixing commands with `bundle exec`:

        steps:
          - run: bundle exec pod install
    

## Configuring Deployment

After you have a signed app you are ready to configure deployment. Distributing the app is easy with one of the following:

- [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/)
- [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/)
- [Beta by Crashlytics](http://try.crashlytics.com/beta/)
- [TestFairy](https://testfairy.com/)

Then you should set up environment variables for your service of choice:

### Hockey App

{:.no_toc}

1. Log in to Hockey app and create a new API token on the [Tokens page](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/auth_tokens). Your token will need at least upload permission to upload new builds to Hockey App.

2. Give your new API token a name specific to CircleCI such as "CircleCI Distribution".

3. Copy the token, and log into CircleCI and go to the Project Settings page for your app.

4. Create a new Environment Variable with the name `HOCKEY_APP_TOKEN` and paste the token as the value. You can now access this token in any job.

### Beta By Crashlytics

{:.no_toc}

1. Log in to Fabric.io and visit your organization's settings page. ![Fabric.io loging image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/fabric-org-settings-page.png)

2. Click your organization (CircleCI in the image above), and click the API key and Build Secret links to reveal the items. ![Fabric.io org image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/fabric-api-creds-page.png)

3. Navigate to your App's Project Settings page in the CircleCI app, and under Environment Variables add two new items named `CRASHLYTICS_API_KEY` and `CRASHLYTICS_SECRET`, with the values you find on Crashlytics website.

### TestFairy

{:.no_toc}

To set up your app on TestFairy, follow these steps:

![TestFairy preferences image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/testfairy-open-preferences.png)

1. On the TestFairy dashboard, navigate to the Preferences page.
2. On the Preferences page, go to the API Key section.
3. Copy your API key and go to your application's project settings within the CircleCI application.
4. To deploy, add a job to your configuration using [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/beta-deployment/) or `curl` (example below).

{% raw %}

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    #  insert build code here...
  deploy:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Deploy to TestFairy
          command: |
            curl \
              -A "CircleCI 2.0" \
              -F api_key="$TESTFAIRY_API_KEY" \
              -F comment="CircleCI build $CIRCLE_BUILD_URL" \
              -F file=@path/to/ipafile.ipa \
              https://upload.testfairy.com/api/upload/

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy:
        requires:
          - build
        filters:
          branches:
            only: master

```

{% endraw %}

For a complete list of available options, please visit the [TestFairy Upload API documentation](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html)

## Resolving Common Simulator Issues

{:.no_toc}

A series of simulator-related issues are known to happen on some projects. Here are the most frequent of those:

- **Xcode version is not available.** We install a few different versions of Xcode in each build image and keep those updated with the latest point releases. Therefore to use the latest Xcode 8.3, for example, which is `8.3.3`, it is sufficient to specify `8.3` in your `config.yml`. If a newer point release of 8.3 comes out, we will make that one available under the same `8.3` version on CircleCI.

- **Dependency version mismatches.** If you see that the version of the dependencies used in a job are not the expected ones, please try rebuilding without cache — chances are an older dependency got stuck in the cache and is not allowing for the newer version to get installed.

- **Cryptic compilation errors.** If you see compile-time errors that do not really make sense, please check if the version of Xcode you are using in your build is the same one you are using locally. When the `config.yml` of the project does not specify an Xcode version, we default to an older Xcode which might not support the necessary features.

- **Ruby segfaults.** We have seen cases where some of the Ruby gems used during a job would produce a segmentation fault in Ruby. This might happen because of the mismatch of Ruby version used to build the gem and the Ruby version used to run it. Please make sure that the Ruby version used locally is the same as the one used on CircleCI. You can install a newer version Ruby in the container by following [this guide](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/installing-a-newer-ruby-version-on-ios-os-x-containers/2466).

- **Inconsistent timeouts during test runs.** If your UI tests are timing out, try running them [before the rest of your tests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44361446/ios-uitests-failed-idetestoperationsobservererrordomain-code-13/48299184#48299184). You can also try using the raw `xcodebuild` command or the `xctool` command. Some issues are only present in one of these tools.

- **Errors while installing code signing certificates.** Please check out the iOS Code Signing document.

- **Many iOS app developers use tools that generate substantial amounts of code.** In such cases CircleCI may not correctly detect the Xcode workspace, project, or scheme. Instead, you can specify these through environment variables.

### Constraints on macOS-based Builds

{:.no_toc}

Splitting tests between parallel containers on macOS is currently not supported. We suggest using a workflow with parallel jobs to build with different Xcode versions, or a workflow with parallel jobs to run different test targets. Please check [this doc]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows/#workflows-configuration-examples) for examples of workflows with parallel jobs.

## Sample Configuration with Multiple Executor Types (macOS + Docker)

It is possible to use multiple [executor types](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/) in the same workflow. In the following example each push of an iOS project will be built on macOS, and additional iOS tools ([SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger)) will be run in Docker.

{% raw %}

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    macos:
      xcode: "9.0"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output

    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Fetch CocoaPods Specs
          command: |
            curl https://cocoapods-specs.circleci.com/fetch-cocoapods-repo-from-s3.sh | bash -s cf
      - run:
          name: Install CocoaPods
          command: pod install --verbose

      - run:
          name: Build and run tests
          command: fastlane scan
          environment:
            SCAN_DEVICE: iPhone 8
            SCAN_SCHEME: WebTests

      - store_test_results:
          path: output/scan
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output

  swiftlint:
    docker:
      - image: dantoml/swiftlint:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: swiftlint lint --reporter junit | tee result.xml
      - store_artifacts:
          path: result.xml
      - store_test_results:
          path: result.xml

  danger:
    docker:
      - image: dantoml/danger:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: danger

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-test-lint:
    jobs:
      - swiftlint
      - danger
      - build-and-test
```

## React Native projects

{:.no_toc}

React Native projects can be built on CircleCI 2.0 using `macos` and `docker` executor types. Please check out [this example React Native application](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-react-native) on GitHub for a full example of a React Native project.
