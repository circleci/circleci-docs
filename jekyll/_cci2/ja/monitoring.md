## Advanced System Monitoring

Enable the ability to forward system and Docker metrics to supported platforms by going to Replicated Admin > Settings > Metrics, for example `https://example.com:8800/settings#metrics`. Then, click Enable Metrics. ![Enable Metrics]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/enable_metrics1.png)

### Supported Platform(s)

Currently, only AWS CloudWatch is supported. Click AWS CloudWatch to begin configuration. ![AWS CloudWatch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/enable_metrics2.png)

### Configuration

There are two options for configuration:

- Use the IAM Instance Profile of the services box and configure your custom region and namespace. ![Configuration IAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/enable_metrics3a.png)

- Alternatively, you may use your AWS Access Key and Secret Key along with your custom region and namespace. ![Configuration Alt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/enable_metrics3b.png)

Verify that metrics are forwarding by going to the AWS CloudWatch console.

### Metrics Details

Services VM Host and Docker metrics are forwarded via [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf), a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and reporting metrics.

Following are the metrics that are enabled: - [CPU](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/cpu/README.md#cpu-time-measurements) - [Disk](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/disk/README.md#metrics) - [Memory](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/mem/README.md#metrics) - [Networking](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/net/NET_README.md#measurements--fields) - [Docker](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/docker#metrics)

Metrics such as `cpu_time` & `docker_swarm` can be toggled on or off in your config file.

## Scheduled Scaling

By default, an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is created on your AWS account. Go to your EC2 Dashboard and select Auto Scaling Groups from the left side menu. Then, in the Instances tab, set the Desired and Minimum number to define the number Nomad Clients to spin up and keep available. Use the Scaling Policy tab of the Auto Scaling page to scale up your group automatically only at certain times, see below for best practices for defining policies.

Refer to the Shutting Down a Nomad Client section of the [Nomad]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/nomad/#shutting-down-a-nomad-client) document for instructions on draining and scaling down the Nomad Clients.

### Auto Scaling Policy Best Practices

There is a [blog post series](https://circleci.com/blog/mathematical-justification-for-not-letting-builds-queue/) wherein CircleCI engineering spent time running simulations of cost savings for the purpose of developing a general set of best practices for Auto Scaling. Consider the following best practices when setting up AWS Auto Scaling:

1. In general, size your cluster large enough to avoid queueing builds. That is, less than one second of queuing for most workloads and less than 10 seconds for workloads run on expensive hardware or at highest parallellism. Sizing to reduce queuing to zero is best practice because of the high cost of developer time, it is difficult to create a model in which developer time is cheap enough for under-provisioning to be cost-effective.

2. Create an Auto Scaling group with a Step Scaling policy that scales up during the normal working hours of the majority of developers and scales back down at night. Scaling up during the weekday normal working hours and back down at night is the best practice to keep queue times down during peak development without over provisioning at night when traffic is low. Looking at millions of builds over time, a bell curve during normal working hour emerges for most data sets.

This is in contrast to auto scaling throughout the day based on traffic fluctuations because modeling revealed that boot times are actually too long to prevent queuing in real time. Use [Amazon's Step Policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html) instructions to set this up along with Cloudwatch Alarms.

## Logging For 1.0

Collecting and centralizing logs is an essential component of monitoring. The logs provide audit trails as well as debugging information for infrastructure failures. This document describes how you can integrate CircleCI with your logging solution in the following sections:

### Basic System Monitoring with CloudWatch

Enable CloudWatch by going to Replicated Admin > Settings > Enhanced AWS Integration (1.0 Only) > Enable Cloudwatch, for example, `https://example.com:8800/settings#enhanced_aws`. **Note:** CloudWatch does **not** support monitoring of macOS containers.

CloudWatch already monitors the health and basic checks for EC2 instances, for example, CPU, memory, disk space, and basic counts with alerts. Consider upgrading machine types for the Services instance or decrease the number of CPUs per container if CPU or memory become a bottleneck.

### Installing Logging Appliance Agents

CircleCI 1.0 Builders store logs in `/var/log/**/*.log` except for Docker, which stores logs in `/var/lib/docker/containers/**/*-json.log`.

Logging appliances generally require installation of a custom agent on each machine and configuration that collects logs and forwards them to a service. Some available logging appliances are:

- [Amazon Cloudwatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/details/#log-monitoring)
- [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
- [LogDNA](https://logdna.com/)
- [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)
- [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/)

Configure the agent according to the environment, the authentication mechanisms, and centralized logging service discovery mechanism. You can reuse your current practices for setting up the agent and configuration.

If you are using CircleCI Terraform/CloudFormation templates, you can modify the launch configuration to add the hook to install the agent and run it as follows:

    #!/usr/bin/bash
    
    
    #### Log configuration - using Amazon CloudWatch as an example
    
    # Install the agent, using Amazon CloudWatch as an example
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py
    
    # Configure agent
    cat <<EOF >/root/awslogs.conf
    [general]
    state_file = /var/awslogs/state/agent-state
    
    [/var/log/circle-builder/circle.log]
    datetime_format = %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S
    file = /var/log/circle-builder/circle.log
    buffer_duration = 5000
    log_stream_name = {instance_id}
    initial_position = end_of_file
    log_group_name = /var/log/circle-builder/circle.log
    EOF
    
    
    ## Run agent
    python ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region us-west-2 --non-interactive --configfile=/root/awslogs.conf
    
    #### Run CircleCI Builder as typical
    
    curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-enterprise/init-builder-0.2.sh | \
        SERVICES_PRIVATE_IP=<private ip address of services box> \
        CIRCLE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=<passphrase entered on system console (services box port 8800) settings> \
        bash
    

If you are using an orchestration tool, for example Chef, Puppet, or SaltStack, it is possible to apply the appropriate recipe or cookbook to the builder instances.

### Integrating With Syslog

CircleCI 1.0 Builders integrate with the `syslog` facility. `Syslog` is a widely used standard for logging, and most agents integrate with it seamlessly. Configure the builder machines to emit logs to the `syslog` facility by setting `CIRCLE_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` to `true` in the launch configuration:

    #!/bin/bash
    curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-enterprise/init-builder-0.2.sh | \
        CIRCLE_LOG_TO_SYSLOG=true \
        SERVICES_PRIVATE_IP=<private ip address of services box> \
        CIRCLE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=<passphrase entered on system console (services box port 8800) settings> \
        bash
    

Then, configure `syslog` to forward logging to a centralized `rsyslog` server, or configure a local logging agent to monitor the `syslog` rather than monitor files.

The Services machine uses Docker. It is possible to customize the Docker daemon to route logs to your desired supported destination, see the [Docker documentation on logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/logging/overview/) for details.

**Note:** Many tools default to file-based logging, and *using the syslog facility as the only mode of logging may accidentally ignore important logging info*. Configuring custom agents to watch all of `/var/log/**/*` will result in capturing most logging files including `syslog`.

<!---## Health Monitoring Metrics

CloudWatch integration enables the following custom metrics for health monitoring:

 * `ContainersReserved` gives you a view of usage over time for capacity planning and budget estimation.
 * `ContainersLeaked` should be 0 or close to 0, an increase indicates a potential infrastructure issue.
 * `ContainersAvailable` is used for Auto Scaling.  If the value is too high, consider shutting some machines down, if the value is too low, consider starting up machines.

 * `circle.run-queue.builds` and `circle.run-queue.containers` expresses the degree to which the system is under-provisioned  and number of queued builds that are not running.  Ideally, the ASG will account for this as well.  Values that are too high may indicate an outage or incident.

 * `circle.state.running-builds` provides a general insight into current usage.

 * Note that `circle.state.num-masters` includes the web server host in the Services machine that does **not** run any builds.  That means the following:
   * If the value is 0, there is an outage or system is in maintenance.  Risk of dropping some github hooks.
   * If the value is 1, there are no Builders, so web traffic and GitHub hooks are accepted, but not run.
   * If the value is 1 + n, there are n builders running and visible to the system. If this is less than the total number of builders launched through AWS, your builders are most likely not launching correctly. If builds are queueing, but this number says you have builders available to the system, you may need to launch more builders.
