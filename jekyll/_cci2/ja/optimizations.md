Get started with speeding up your job runs, workflows, and image builds with the following example snippets.

## Caching Dependencies

{% raw %}

        steps: # a collection of executable commands
          - checkout # special step to check out source code to the working directory
          - restore_cache: # restores saved dependency cache if the Branch key template or requirements.txt files have not changed since the previous run
              key: deps1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
          - run: # install and activate virtual environment with pip
              command: |
                python3 -m venv venv
                . venv/bin/activate
                pip install -r requirements.txt
          - save_cache: # special step to save dependency cache
              key: deps1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "requirements.txt" }}
              paths:
                - "venv"
    

{% endraw %}

## Parallelism

    # ~/.circleci/config.yml
    version: 2
    jobs:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/<language>:<version TAG>
      test:
        parallelism: 4
    

## Docker Layer Caching

DLC is a premium feature and you must open a support ticket to enable it on your account for an additional fee.

    version: 2
    jobs:
     build:
       docker:
         # DLC does nothing here, its caching depends on commonality of the image layers.
          - image: circleci/node:9.8.0-stretch-browsers
        steps:
          - checkout
          - setup_remote_docker:
              docker_layer_caching: true
          # DLC will explicitly cache layers here and try to avoid rebuilding.
          - run: docker build .
