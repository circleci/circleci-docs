This document describes how to create a badge that displays your project's build status (passed or failed) in a README or other document.

## Overview

Status badges are commonly embedded in project READMEs, although they can be placed in any web document. CircleCI provides a tool to generate embed code for status badges. By default, a badge displays the status of a project's default branch, though you can also select other branches.

You can generate code for the following formats:

- Image URL
- Markdown
- Textile
- Rdoc
- AsciiDoc
- reStructuredText
- pod

## Steps

1. In the *Notifications* section of your project's settings, click *Status Badges*.
2. By default, the badge displays the status of your project's default branch. If you want to show the status of a different branch, use the Branch dropdown menu to select it.
3. (Optional) If your project is private, you will need to [create a project API token]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-project-api-token).
4. (Optional) If you created a token in the previous step, select the token you want to use in the *API Token* dropdown menu.
5. Select the appropriate language from the *Embed Code* dropdown menu.
6. Copy and paste the generated link in the document where you want to display the status badge.

## Customization

If you find the default status badge too minimal, you can use the [shield style](https://shields.io/). To use the shield style, replace `style=svg` with `style=shield` in the link you generated above.
