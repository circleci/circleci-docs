This quickstart guide shows you the fastest route from sign up, through connecting an existing project, and getting a first passing pipeline. Then you discover the in-app config editor to make changes to your pipeline and invite your team members to collaborate on your new project.

If you would rather jump to a full list of CircleCI `config.yml` options, see the xref:configuration-reference#[Configuration reference].

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Choose a project you would like to connect to CircleCI. This will be an existing repo in GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab. If you do not have a project to use, create a new repo so you can follow along. Call it "hello-circleci".

== GitHub

=== Sign up

Sign up for a link:https://circleci.com/signup[free CircleCI account]. You can sign up by either using your email address, and then connecting your GitHub account, or just connect your GitHub account right away

Continuous integration is a practice that helps developers integrate their code into a main branch of a shared repository early and often. Every developer commits daily. Every commit triggers automated tests and builds. Bugs are identified and repaired in minutes.

On the <a  href="https://app.circleci.com/projects/">Projects</a> page, click the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ buttons to view your configuration file. Make any change and save it. You should see a new pipeline run and likely fail. This is a primary benefit of CircleCI: identifying failures early.

A <a class="no-external-icon" href="https://circleci.com/docs/workflows/">workflow</a> is a set of rules that defines a collection of jobs and their run order. Workflows support complex job orchestration using a simple set of configuration keys to help you quickly resolve failures.
