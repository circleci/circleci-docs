NOTE: Scheduled pipelines are not currently available for GitLab and GitHub App projects. To find out if you authorized your GitHub account through the GitHub OAuth app, or the GitHub App, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration page].

Scheduled pipelines are simply triggered pipelines, and by default, for each trigger, every workflow that has been configured will run. You can filter workflows in your `.circleci/config.yml` file with conditionals. The conditionals you set will control which workflows will run when a scheduled pipeline is triggered. These conditions can be set with built-in pipeline values, or through custom pipeline parameters. The examples below demonstrate various ways to set conditionals in your `.circleci/config.yml` file.

[#schedule-using-built-in-pipeline-values]
## Schedule using built-in pipeline values

One way to implement workflows filtering is by using pipeline values. The example below uses the built-in pipeline values `pipeline.trigger_source` and `pipeline.schedule.name`. The examples use `daily_build` and `nightly_build` as the `pipeline.schedule.name`, however, the value of `pipeline.schedule.name` can be whatever you would like when using scheduled pipelines.

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
daily-run-workflow:
# run workflow only when the daily_build pipeline is triggered
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - test
    - build

nightly-run-workflow:
# run workflow only when the nightly_build pipeline is triggered
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ nightly_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - build
    - deploy
...
```

Note that in the above example, the second `equal` under `when` is not strictly necessary. The `pipeline.schedule.name` is an available pipeline value when the pipeline is triggered by a schedule.

You may also add filtering for workflows that should *not* run when a schedule is triggered:

{% raw %}
```yaml
version: 2.1
...
daily-run-workflow:
# run workflow only when the daily_build pipeline is triggered
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - test
    - build

nightly-run-workflow:
# do NOT run workflow if a scheduled pipeline is triggered
  when:
    not:
      equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
  jobs:
   - build
   - deploy
...
```
{% endraw %}

For a full list of pipeline values, visit the xref:pipeline-variables/#pipeline-values[Pipeline values and parameters] page.

[#schedule-using-pipeline-parameters]
## Schedule using pipeline parameters

In the example below, a parameter is created called `run-schedule`, which is set as `type: boolean` and `default: false`. This allows the workflows section to use `when` to specify conditionals about when the pipeline should run. If you use the `when` conditional, you will also need to set a `when: not:`, like in the example below.

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
# set pipeline parameters
parameters:
  run-schedule:
    type: boolean
    default: false

workflows:
  # do not run the scheduled pipeline if build-test-deploy
  build-test-deploy:
    when:
      not: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>
    jobs:
      - test
      - build
  # run the scheduled pipeline if nightly-snapshot
  nightly-snapshot:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy
...
```

[#set-up-multiple-workflows-with-multiple-schedules]
== Set up multiple workflows with multiple schedules

The example below demonstrates three workflows scheduled with pipeline values. Two workflows will run on the same schedule (`daily_build`), and one will run on a different schedule (`weekly_build`).

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
workflows:
# run workflow only when the daily_build pipeline is triggered
  daily-run-workflow:
    when:
      equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-one

  nightly-run-workflow:
  # run workflow only when the daily_build pipeline is triggered
    when:
      equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-two

  weekly-run-workflow:
  # run workflow only when the weekly_build pipeline is triggered
    when:
      equal: [ weekly_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-three
...
```
