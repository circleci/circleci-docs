Metrics such as CPU or memory usage and internal metrics are useful in:

* Quickly detecting incidents and abnormal behavior
* Dynamically scaling compute resources
* Retroactively understanding infrastructure-wide issues

== Metrics Collection

=== Scope
Your CircleCI server installation collects a number of metrics and logs by default, which can be useful in monitoring
the health of your system and debug issues with your installation. However, requirements differ vastly between use
cases. Hence, features around local observability are provided on an as-is basis, and we kindly ask to make use of the
flexibility and extensibility of the system, should you feel that the functionality provided is not sufficient for your
needs.

Most importantly, take note of the following:

NOTE: You cannot modify dashboards that are provided by CircleCI. 

NOTE: Data is retained for a maximum of 15 days.

=== Prometheus
https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is a leading monitoring and alerting system for Kubernetes. Server 3.x ships with basic
implementation of monitoring common performance metrics. 

=== Telegraf
Most services running on server will report StatsD metrics to the https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/[Telegraf] pod running in server.
The configuration is fully customizable, so you can forward your metrics from Telegraf to any output that is supported
by Telegraf via https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/plugins/#output-plugins[output plugins]. By default, it will provide a
metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape so that the metrics can be viewed in Grafana.

== Accessing the metrics dashboards
Dashboards are provided in the KOTs admin console. If you have recommendations for additional data to be provided here please let us know. The currently provided dashboard provides important metrics for each container in your installation. Per container, it allows
you to view the following metrics:

* CPU Saturation
* Memory Saturation
* Number of running pods
* Most recent logs
* File I/O (in B/s)
* Network I/O (in B/s)
* Number of service restarts

== Tips and Troubleshooting

=== Observing pod logs
You can check that services/pods are reporting metrics correctly by checking if they are being reported to stdout. To do
this, examine the logs of the `circleci-telegraf` pod using `kubectl logs` or a tool like https://github.com/wercker/stern[stern].

To view logs for Telegraf, run the following:

* `kubectl get pods` to get a list of services
* `kubectl logs -f circleci-telegraf-<hash>`, substituting the hash for your installation.

While monitoring the current log stream, perform some actions with your server installation (e.g. logging in/out or
running a workflow). These activities should be logged, showing that metrics are being reported. Most metrics you see logged
will be from the frontend pod. However, when you run workflows, you should also see metrics reported by the dispatcher,
`legacy-dispatcher`, `output-processor` and `workflows-conductor`, as well as metrics concerning cpu, memory and disk stats.

You may also check the logs by running `kubectl logs circleci-telegraf-<hash> -n <namespace> -f` to confirm that your
output provider (e.g. influx) is listed in the configured outputs.
