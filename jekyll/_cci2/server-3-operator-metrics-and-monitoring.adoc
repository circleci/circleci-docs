Metrics such as CPU or memory usage, number of executed builds and internal metrics are useful in:

* Quickly detecting incidents and abnormal behavior
* Dynamically scaling compute resources
* Retroactively understanding infrastructure-wide issues

## Metrics Collection

### Grafana
Server ships with https://grafana.com/[Grafana] which has become the worldâ€™s most popular technology used to compose
observability dashboards. We have integrated with Prometheus & Loki Logs so you can create dashboards, set up alerts,
search for errors and more.

### Loki
Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be
very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each
log stream.

### Prometheus
https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is a leading monitoring and alerting system for Kubernetes. Server ships with basic
implementation of monitoring common performance metrics.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

### Pod Logs

You can check that services/pods are reporting metrics correctly by checking if they are being reported to stdout. To do
this, examine the logs of the `circleci-telegraf` pod using `kubectl logs` or a tool like https://github.com/wercker/stern[stern].

To view logs for Telegraf, run the following:

* `kubectl get pods` to get a list of services
* `kubectl logs -f circleci-telegraf-<hash>`, substituting the hash for your installation.

While monitoring the current log stream, perform some actions with your server installation (e.g. logging in/out or
running a workflow). These activities should be logged, showing that metrics are being reported. Most metrics you see logged
will be from the frontend pod. However, when you run workflows, you should also see metrics reported by the dispatcher,
`legacy-dispatcher`, `output-processor` and `workflows-conductor`, as well as metrics concerning cpu, memory and disk stats.

You may also check the logs by running `kubectl logs circleci-telegraf-<hash> -n <namespace> -f` to confirm that your
output provider (e.g. influx) is listed in the configured outputs.
