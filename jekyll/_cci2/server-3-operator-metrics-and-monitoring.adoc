Metrics such as CPU or memory usage, number of executed builds and internal metrics are useful in:

* Quickly detecting incidents and abnormal behavior
* Dynamically scaling compute resources
* Retroactively understanding infrastructure-wide issues

== Metrics Collection

=== Scope
Your CircleCI server installation collects a number of metrics and logs by default, which can be useful in monitoring
the health of your system and debug issues with your installation. However, requirements differ vastly between use
cases. Hence, features around local observability are provided on an as-is basis, and we kindly ask to make use of the
flexibility and extensibility of the system, should you feel that the functionality provided is not sufficient for your
needs.

Most importantly, take note of the following:

NOTE: You cannot modify dashboards that are provided by CircleCI. However, you can make copies of them that are editable.

NOTE: Data is retained for a maximum of 15 days.

=== Grafana
Server ships with https://grafana.com/[Grafana] which has become the world's most popular technology used to compose
observability dashboards. We have integrated with https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] & https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] logging,
so you can create dashboards, set up alerts, search for errors, and more.

=== Loki
https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, log aggregation system inspired by https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus].
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each
log stream.

=== Prometheus
https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is a leading monitoring and alerting system for Kubernetes. Server 3.x ships with basic
implementation of monitoring common performance metrics.

=== Telegraf
Most services running on server will report StatsD metrics to the https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/[Telegraf] pod running in server.
The configuration is fully customizable, so you can forward your metrics from Telegraf to any output that is supported
by Telegraf via https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/plugins/#output-plugins[output plugins]. By default, it will provide a
metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape so that the metrics can be viewed in Grafana.

== Accessing the metrics dashboards on Grafana
To access Grafana, you will need to port-forward the Grafana service to your local machine:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 8080:80
----
This will make Grafana available in your browser on your local machine at `http://localhost:8080`.

You can find the dashboards by going directly to `http://localhost:8080/dashboards` or by navigating there
using the menu on the left side.

==== General usage tips
If you are new to Grafana, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with Grafana's dashboard UI
by studying the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/[Grafana documentation]. You should also read the
section on https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/[templates and variables], as most of the dashboards
we provide make use of that feature.

==== The Overview dashboard
The Overview gives you the most important metrics and logs for each container in your installation. Per container, it allows
you to view the following metrics:

* CPU Saturation
* Memory Saturation
* Number of running pods
* Most recent logs
* File I/O (in B/s)
* Network I/O (in B/s)
* Number of service restarts

It is best suited for quick health checks on individual services.

==== The Pod Metrics dashboard
The Pod Metrics dashboard will give you more detailed resource usage for the entire cluster in total as well as broken
down by pod. You can also inspect resource usage individually by pod as well as resource requests and limits.

==== The Nomad dashboard
For jobs that are not run on external VMs or via runner, this dashboard gives an overview on the number of jobs
that are currently running, pending, or are dead (i.e. have been processed). You can also view the number of
healthy Nomad server pods, their memory saturation, their CPU saturation and their most recent logs.

==== The Cluster Monitoring for Kubernetes dashboard
This dashboard gives a more high-level view on the most important health metrics of either your entire cluster
or individually by cluster node. Metrics included are memory and CPU usage as well as Network and file I/O.

== Tips and Troubleshooting

=== How to set up alerts
You can set up alerts via Grafana. Please check the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/[Grafana documentation]
for detailed instructions.

=== A dashboard is not showing any data
If you don't see any data in a dashboard, this could have several reasons:

* Check if the dashboard is using variables and, if it does, that you have selected the right namespace
and at least one service or pod to show metrics for.
* You might have selected an initialization container that will stop running once it has fulfilled its
purpose. Try another container.
* Check if the selected time range is not more than 14 days in the past.

=== Observing pod logs
You can check that services/pods are reporting metrics correctly by checking if they are being reported to stdout. To do
this, examine the logs of the `circleci-telegraf` pod using `kubectl logs` or a tool like https://github.com/wercker/stern[stern].

To view logs for Telegraf, run the following:

* `kubectl get pods` to get a list of services
* `kubectl logs -f circleci-telegraf-<hash>`, substituting the hash for your installation.

While monitoring the current log stream, perform some actions with your server installation (e.g. logging in/out or
running a workflow). These activities should be logged, showing that metrics are being reported. Most metrics you see logged
will be from the frontend pod. However, when you run workflows, you should also see metrics reported by the dispatcher,
`legacy-dispatcher`, `output-processor` and `workflows-conductor`, as well as metrics concerning cpu, memory and disk stats.

You may also check the logs by running `kubectl logs circleci-telegraf-<hash> -n <namespace> -f` to confirm that your
output provider (e.g. influx) is listed in the configured outputs.
