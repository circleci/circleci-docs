You can run your jobs in the linux VM (virtual machine) execution environment by using the machine executor and specifying a Linux image. Using the machine executor runs your jobs in a dedicated, ephemeral VM.

Using the machine executor gives your application full access to OS resources and provides you with full control over the job environment. This control can be useful in situations where you need full access to the network stack; for example, to listen on a network interface, or to modify the system with `sysctl` commands.

To use the machine executor, use the [`machine` key]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#machine) in your job configuration and specify an image:

**CircleCI Cloud** The use of `machine: true` is deprecated. You must specify an image to use.
{: class="alert alert-caution"}

{:.tab.machineblock.Cloud}
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2004:current
    resource_class: large
```

{:.tab.machineblock.Server}
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine: true
    resource_class: large
```

You can view the list of available images [in the docs Configuration Reference]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#available-linux-machine-images), or on the [Developer Hub](https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=machine). If you are working on an installation of CircleCI server, you will notice in the example above the syntax is slightly different, and the available Linux images are managed by your system administrator.

## Pre-installed software
{: #pre-installed-software }

The most up to date list of pre-installed software can be found on the [Discuss](https://discuss.circleci.com/tag/machine-images) page.

If you are already using an image and would like to verify the all the packages that come pre-installed, you can run the `apt list --installed` command as a step, like in the example below:

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
jobs:
  whats-installed:
    machine: # executor type
      image: ubuntu-2004:2022.07.1
    steps:
      - run: apt list --installed
...
```

Additional packages can be installed with `sudo apt-get install <package>`. If the package in question is not found, `sudo apt-get update` may be required before installing it.

## Use machine with Docker
{:  #use-machine-with-docker }

Using the machine executor also means that you get full access to the Docker process. This allows you to run privileged Docker containers and build new Docker images.

The following example uses an image and enables [Docker layer caching]({{ site.baseurl }}/docker-layer-caching) (DLC) which is useful when you are building Docker images during your jobs.

```yaml
machine:
  image: ubuntu-2004:202104-01
  docker_layer_caching: true    # default - false
```

## Using machine and IP ranges
{: #using-machine-and-ip-ranges }

The IP range `192.168.53.0/24` is reserved by CircleCI for internal use on the machine executor. This range should not be used in your jobs.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps }
