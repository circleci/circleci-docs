<summary>How to trigger a workflow via CircleCI API v2</summary>

 CircleCI API (v2) doesn't currently provide a dedicated endpoint to specifically trigger a new workflow.

However, it is still possible to trigger a specific workflow using the "[Trigger a new pipeline"](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/triggerPipeline) endpoint. It requires some modification to your `config.yml`, and the use of [pipeline parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration), as well as, [conditional workflows]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#using-when-in-workflows).

For example, if you have the following `workflows` declared in your `config.yml`:

```yml
workflows:
  version: 2
  build:
    jobs:
      - job_a
  test:
    jobs:
      - job_b
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - job_c
```

You will need to declare the following [pipeline parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration):

```yml
version: 2.1  
parameters:
  run_workflow_build:
    default: true
    type: boolean

  run_workflow_test:
    default: true
    type: boolean

  run_workflow_deploy:
    default: true
    type: boolean
```

_**Note**: setting the parameters' default value to "true" will allow the workflows to run when the pipeline is triggered by pushing commits._

And modify the `workflows` section as follows:

```yml
workflows:
  version: 2
  build:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run_workflow_build >>
    jobs:
      - job_a
  test:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run_workflow_test >>
    jobs:
      - job_b
  deploy:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run_workflow_deploy >>
    jobs:
      - job_c
```


Using the above example, the cURL request to only run the `test` workflow would be (i_n the following requests your_ `vcs-slug` _will be_ `bitbucket` _or_ `github` _depending on which VCS you use_):

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/vcs-slug/org-name/repo-name/pipeline \
  --header 'Circle-Token: ***********************************' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"parameters":{"run_workflow_build":false, "run_workflow_deploy":false}}'
```

_**Note**: keep in mind that you have to use a [personal API token]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token); project tokens are currently not supported on CircleCI API (v2)._

For clarity, you could also pass the parameter corresponding to the workflow you wish to run. Doing so would have the exact same outcome as the above request because the pipeline parameters were declared with a default value set to "true":

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/vcs-slug/org-name/repo-name/pipeline \
  --header 'Circle-Token: ***********************************' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"parameters":{"run_workflow_build":false, "run_workflow_test":true, "run_workflow_deploy":false}}'
```

# Common Issues
{: #common-issues }

<details markdown=block>
<summary>Why Do My Tests Pass Locally but Fail on CircleCI?</summary>

This behavior has several possible explanations:

* **Different language versions**. Ensure you are using the same language version on your machine and on CircleCI.
* **Different package versions**. Explicitly specify package versions in your configuration file.
* **Timezone troubles**. Some testing frameworks may not have timezone-aware modules. If the machine does not have a set timezone, some tests may fail. See [this question]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/faq/#how-can-i-set-the-timezone-in-docker-images) in the FAQ for more details.
* **File ordering**. Some filesystems maintain an ordered file structure for each directory. This means that all files are read in the same order during each run. However, the filesystems in our build containers are unordered. If your tests only pass when run in a certain order, they may fail on CircleCI.
* **"Out of Memory" errors**. If a process in your build container uses too much memory, Linux's OOM killer may end it. If you are interested in recording your memory usage, visit [How to record a job's memory usage](https://support.circleci.com//hc/en-us/articles/360043994872).
* **Differing startup times**. Applications like Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL may take more time to start up on CircleCI. You can fix this by explicitly waiting for a service to be available before running tests.
* **Unreliable services**. If your tests rely on a third-party service, check that the service is actually running.

Please submit a [support ticket](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us) if you need additional assistance with your builds.

<summary>Build "Not Running" due to concurrency limit but no other job is running</summary>

### Why is this happening?
{: #why-is-this-happening }
{:.no_toc}

If a job is not starting and showing a status "**Not Running**" after you triggered a pipeline, it means that you have reached the **concurrency limit** of your plan.

This is most likely to happen to customers on our [Free Plan](https://circleci.com/pricing/), as they have access to use a single container at any one time (1x concurrency), therefore jobs will queue if that container is already in use.

However, customers on plans with a higher concurrency limit can also encounter this situation.

The delayed start of your job, and the fact it remains in a "Not Running" state before eventually starting, is due to the fact that other jobs are still running when the new job is triggered.

### Check for running SSH jobs
{: #check-for-running-ssh-jobs }
{:.no_toc}

We found that this situation frequently arises due to running SSH jobs; once you navigate away from a running SSH job it won't appear in the pipelines view, so one can assume that no jobs are running at the time.

SSH jobs, along with all jobs in a given project are listed in the "**legacy jobs view**":

`https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/{vcs}/{org}/{project}/jobs`

An SSH job will remain available for an SSH connection for **10 minutes after the job finishes** \- if SSH has not been accessed, then the job will **automatically end after 10 minutes**.

After you SSH into the job, the SSH connection will remain open for **up to two hours**. That's why we advise to always manually cancel SSH jobs after you have finished with them to make sure your build queue is as free as possible.

To do so, please follow instructions outlined in the Support article "[How to see running SSH jobs](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047125652-How-to-see-running-SSH-jobs)".

<summary>Docker Layer Caching FAQ</summary>

[Docker Layer Caching (DLC)]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#overview) can reduce Docker image build times on CircleCI by caching individual layers of any Docker images built as part of your jobs. Here are some frequently asked questions around DLC:

### **Is DLC available between different workflows under the same project?**
{: #is-dlc-available-between-different-workflows-under-the-same-project }
{:.no_toc}

Yes, DLC is not locked to workflows or jobs. You can create a maximum of 50 DLC volumes per project (including any parallelism).

### **Why are subsequent builds not able to access the cache consistently?**
{: #why-are-subsequent-builds-not-able-to-access-the-cache-consistently }
{:.no_toc}

If a job fails while calling a specific DLC volume, it would require rebuilding when calling it again, causing inconsistencies. It is worth noting that different jobs may also use different volumes. An example being if two `machine` jobs are run in parallel, they [will get different DLC volumes]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#how-dlc-works).

### How can I delete my DLC cache instance?
{: #how-can-i-delete-my-dlc-cache-instance }
{:.no_toc}

DLC caches are immutable, so they cannot be selectively deleted. However, a cache will be deleted after 3 days of not being used in a project.

### Is DLC guaranteed?
{: #is-dlc-guaranteed }
{:.no_toc}

DLC is not guaranteed. If you are experiencing issues with cache-misses or need high-parallelism, consider try caching using [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-external-cache-sources), which you can optionally implement using the [CircleCI Docker orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker#commands-build).

### As an admin, can I see the content of a DLC volume?
{: #as-an-admin-can-i-see-the-content-of-a-dlc-volume }
{:.no_toc}

While you can see what volume is used for each job, at this time, the content is unavailable.

</details>


<details markdown=block>
<summary>How can I remove my cached docker layers?</summary>

{% raw %}
Running `docker images --no-trunc --format '{{.ID}}' | xargs docker rmi** or **docker volume prune -f` will delete all of the images and their layers from the volume connected to your job.
{% endraw %}


Because of [how DLC works]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#how-dlc-works) you might need to leave this command in your config and run several jobs to remove the DLC layers from all volumes associated with your project.

Alternatively, you can use the config below to run a very short job that consumes all 50 DLC volumes and purges docker caches. You can push it to a feature branch without disrupting your main branches:

```yml
version: 2  
 jobs:    
  docker-purge:  
    docker:    
      - image: cimg/base:2020.01    
    parallelism: 50  
    steps:  
      - setup_remote_docker  
      - run: docker volume prune -f
```

If you're running into issues where stale volume caches are causing problems often, then consider using our new [docker registry image cache orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/cci-x/docker-registry-image-cache) as a substitute. It's more suitable for projects that have high concurrency throughput, or jobs that use parallelism due to the limited number of volumes available.

If you notice errors always happen on the same volume, which you can see by checking the "spin up environment" step or "remote docker" please [contact support ](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket%5Fform%5Fid=855268)

<summary>Resolving "Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed" Errors</summary>

The following type of error can occur when adding a secondary service container for your job:

```
Unexpected environment preparation error: Error response from daemon:   
OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:345:   
starting container process caused "process_linux.go:303:   
getting the final child's pid from pipe caused \"EOF\"": unknown
```

This usually occurs due to a bad [command]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker) being passed to one of the secondary service containers in your job.

The error message occurs due to the secondary service container crashing or exiting prematurely. This means CircleCI cannot get the PID from the Docker daemon and exits with a failure.

Ensure that the command and/or entrypoint are correct so that the container can spin up successfully. This can be be tested locally by using the [CircleCI CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/local-cli/#run-a-job-in-a-container-on-your-machine) to run the job locally and ensure Docker spins up all containers successfully. To resolve the error, check out the documentation for the docker image defined in your config to see which commands can be used at spin up.

</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>How to record a job's memory usage</summary>

Docker executor users can output the max memory consumed by a job by adding the following step to their config:

```yml
- run:  
    command: cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.max_usage_in_bytes  
    when: always
```

**This step should be added as the last step in your job, to identify the max usage after all of the previous steps have completed.**


**Note:** This will be accurate if the job has one Docker image. [Multiple Docker image builds]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/executor-types/#using-multiple-docker-images) will only report the memory usage of the primary image.

Memory usage will be reported in bytes. You can convert to GiB using your favorite search engine to check it against the amount of RAM available to your job, according to its assigned [resource class]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource%5Fclass).

This can help troubleshoot out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

To log memory usage over time for both Docker and machine executors, you can also add this step as the first step in your job:

```yml
- run:  
    command: |  
      while true; do  
        sleep 5  
        # NOTE: on MacOS, the f argument is not supported.  
        # In this case, you can drop the f argument instead.  
        ps auxwwf  
        echo "======"  
      done  
    background: true
```


Alternatively, we can also take advantage of [the top command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) (available on Docker, Machine (Linux) or MacOS executors). This can help show both memory and CPU utilization by individual processes.

```yml
- run:  
    name: Profile CPU and memory every 5s (background)  
    command: |  
      while true; do  
        sleep 5  
        printf "\n\n$(date)\n"  
        top -b -c -n 1  
        echo "======"  
      done  
    background: true
```

**Note** that you have may have to install these tools, or use an alternative command if these tools are not available in the specific Executor.

To get the memory usage of the [Remote Docker environment]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/building-docker-images/#accessing-the-remote-docker-environment), you can pass the ps command **through SSH** with

`ssh remote-docker ps auxwwf`

<summary>Ignoring A Failure In A Step</summary>

In some instances, you may need a job to continue running even if a step returns a non zero exit code. This could be due to a subsequent dependant job in a workflow, or that the success of a step is not a contributing factor to the success of your pipeline.

_Note: Use the following with caution. Ensure you absolutely need this functionality for the particular step, otherwise failures in your jobs may go unnoticed which may have knock-on effects._

The easiest way to implement this is to set up the step as follows:

```yml
- run: my_cool_command || true
```

This ensures that the step always returns a zero exit code, regardless of if the command fails or not.

If you have a mutli-line command, or a script file, then you may consider overriding the default shell options to ensure an exit code zero is passed:

```yml
- run:  
    shell: /bin/bash  
    command: |  
      echo Running my cool command  
      mkdir ~/some_dir  
      my_cool_command
```

For more details on how the default shell options work, and why they have been chosen as the default, please see [our documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#default-shell-options).

<summary>No matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries</summary>

In the "Spin up Environment" step, or elsewhere when pulling a Docker image from a repository, you may run into an error similar to the following:

```
Step 1/26 : FROM <IMAGE>
latest: Pulling from library/<IMAGE>
no matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries
Exited with code 1
```

There are three possible reasons for this error.

1. **Error When Using "Latest" Tag**  
While images are rebuilding on Dockerub, the "latest" tag will become momentarily unavailable while updating. This issue will resolve itself or can be mitigated by selecting a versioned tag.
2. **The Tag Is Not Available**  
A tag that used to be available may no longer be listed or have had it's naming convention modified. A tag may have been "Version8.0" previously and became "Version8.0.0" recently.
3. **Image Is Not Designed For x86, Such As ARM**  
The image you are trying to build may be designed to run on a different architecture, such as an ARM-based CPU. If you need to use an Arm image, consider using an [Arm resource class](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/arm-preview-docs).

# General / JavaScript & Node.js
{: #general-javascript-and-nodejs }

<details markdown=block>
<summary>How can I increase the max memory for Node?</summary>

Node has a default max memory usage of less than 2GB on some 64bit systems. This can cause unexpected memory issues when running on CircleCI. It's possible to adjust the max memory ceiling using a command line flag passed into node:

`--max-old-space-size=<memory in MB>`

The flag can be difficult to ensure is being used. Especially when node processes are forked. The best way to ensure this setting will be picked up by all node processes within the environment is to apply this setting directly to an environment variable, which can be done using Node. 8 or higher

`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`

_**Note**: If you have specified `export NODEOPTIONS=<value>` in your `package.json`, it'll override what you set in the `NODEOPTIONS` environment variable in the `config.yml` (either at the container, job, or step respective level)_

<summary>How to stop building by manually removing the CircleCI webhook and deploy key from your GitHub repository</summary>

You can stop building your project on CircleCI at any time by navigating to the project settings page and clicking the "Stop Building" button.


![Fig_A.jpg]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/stop_building_0.png)

In the event you are for some reason unable to stop building, you can always manually stop building by removing access to the repository from GitHub.

Some reasons you may potentially need to do this:

* You have renamed your Organization, Username, or Repository
* User credentials have become stale

1\. Start by accessing your GitHub repository settings. You can visit this directly by navigating to _https://github.com/Org/Repository_ and clicking the "settings" button on the repository page.

![Fig_B.jpg]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/stop_building_1.png)

2\. From the settings page, on the left side in the vertical navigation, we see the two pages we are interested in, "Webhooks" and "Deploy keys".

![Fig_C.jpg]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/stop_building_2.png)

3\. From the Webhooks page, locate any Webhooks that post to CircleCI and delete them.

![Fig_D.jpg]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/stop_building_3.png)

4\. Lastly, navigate to the "Deploy keys" page and delete the key added by CircleCI

![Fig_E.jpg]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/stop_building_4.png)

This will stop the project from building on CircleCI in the event you need to manually remove access.

<summary>GitHub SSH Deprecation Information & Resolutions</summary>

[On March 15th, 2022 GitHub will be deprecating the types of SSH keys that can be utilized to access their service. ](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/ "https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/")With this deprecation, there are circumstances that could cause your builds to fail on the repository checkout step after the 15th.

**If you meet one of the following criteria, you will need to take action before March 15th, 2022:**

1. Project created between Nov 2nd, 2021 - January 13th, 2022 that has a job using an Ubuntu 14.04-based machine image, including the default `machine: true` image
\- If you don’t [specify a machine image]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#available-machine-images), you are using the default image and you’ll need to take action
2. Project created between Nov 2nd, 2021 - January 13th, 2022 using [deprecated Docker image]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/next-gen-migration-guide/#overview "{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/next-gen-migration-guide/#overview")
3. Project using an uploaded DSA SSH key for checkout purposes

If you meet one of the above, there are sections below that will cover the steps needed to ensure builds continue to run after March 15th, 2022.

**You are not affected by the deprecation, if your project meets one of these criteria:**

1. Your project was set up **before** November 2nd, 2021.
2. Your project was set up **after** January 13th, 2022.
3. Generated a new user/deploy key **after** January 13th, 2022 and it is your "PREFERRED" key

If your project falls under one of the three items listed directly above, you shouldn't need to take any action before March 15th, 2022\. However, if you wish to verify you can check if your key is `ed25519` with the following API call:

<https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/listCheckoutKeys>

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/ORG/PROJECT/checkout-key \
  --header 'Circle-Token: '
```

If the above returns any `items` that have a `"public_key" : "ssh-rsa`, and your project was created between November 2nd, 2021 - January 13th, 2022, you will want to ensure you are using a newer image (convenience image or machine image) or you’ll want to regenerate your user/deploy key. If all the keys returned, or your "PREFERRED" key is `"public_key" : "ssh-ed25519` then no action should be needed.

Depending on your situation, different actions may be required. If you want to find out the OpenSSH version for the image you are utilizing in a job you can run the following:

```
run: ssh -V
```

## Jobs using `machine: true` or specifying a `14.04 ubuntu` Machine image
{: #jobs-using-machine-true-or-specifying-a-1404-ubuntu-machine-image }
{:.no_toc}

You can tell if you fall into this category if any of your jobs look like this:

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    machine: true # This is using the default old machine image
    steps:
      - checkout
```

Or it may look like this which is an example of a 14.04 based image:

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    machine:
      image: circleci/classic:201709-01 # This is a 14.04 based image
    steps:
      - checkout
```

Additionally, you can search via GitHub for these image uses too:

org:CircleCI-Public circleci/classic path:.circleci filename:config.yml

The following options are available, [given the deprecation of older images](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/old-linux-machine-image-remote-docker-deprecation/37572 "https://discuss.circleci.com/t/old-linux-machine-image-remote-docker-deprecation/37572"), **our recommendation is to update your image**. However, all options listed will solve the issue at hand.

1. Update to a [newer machine image]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#available-machine-images "{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#available-machine-images") any listed on that page have the proper items installed
2. Regenerate your deploy/user key in your project settings
   1. This can be done via the UI (Project Settings → SSH Keys → Click `X` on the current key)
         1. Once that is done, you’ll click “Add Deploy key” or “Add User key” depending on which type of key you removed
   2. This can also be done [via the API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey "https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey")
3. Add a `run` step before your `- checkout` step that installs OpenSSH 7.2 or greater, as an example, this would install OpenSSH 8.1p1:

```yml
jobs:
  jobname:
    machine: true
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install OpenSSH 8.1p1
          command: |
            sudo apt-get update
            mkdir ~/tempdownload; 
            cd ~/tempdownload; 
            wget https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz; 
            tar zxvf openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz; 
            cd openssh-8.1p1 && ./configure && make && sudo make install
      - checkout
```

## Jobs using `circleci` convenience images (i.e. `circleci/ruby:2.2.6`)
{: #jobs-using-circleci-convenience-images-ie-circleciruby226 }
{:.no_toc}

The following options are available, given the support for the legacy `circleci` images is going away, the preferred option is to update your image. However, all options listed will solve the issue at hand.

1. Update to a [next-gen convenience image]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/next-gen-migration-guide/#overview "{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/next-gen-migration-guide/#overview"), all next-gen images have the proper items installed
2. Regenerate your deploy/user key in your project settings
   1. This can be done via the UI (Project Settings → SSH Keys → Click `X` on the current key)
         1. Once that is done, you’ll click “Add Deploy key” or “Add User key” depending on which type of key you removed
   2. This can also be done [via the API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey "https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey")
3. Add a `run` step before your `- checkout` step that installs OpenSSH 7.2 or greater, as an example, this would install OpenSSH 8.1p1:

```yml
jobs:
  jobname:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.2.6
    steps:
      - run:

## Jobs using [custom]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/custom-images/ "{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/custom-images/") or non-circleci Docker images
{: #jobs-using-customhttpscirclecicomdocs20custom-images-httpscirclecicomdocs20custom-images-or-non-circleci-docker-images }
{:.no_toc}

If the docker image you are utilizing has OpenSSH 7.2 or greater, and `git` installed, you do not need to make any changes. With both those requirements met, you’ll have no issues with the deprecation. In addition, if your image has _neither_ installed, you'll also not be affected as we'll take care of the checkout process on our side.

With the above in mind, you'll really only be affected on your custom docker images if you specifically installed an old OpenSSH version.

1\. Regenerate your deploy/user key in your project settings

* This can be done via the UI (Project Settings → SSH Keys → Click `X` on the current key)
   * Once that is done, you’ll click “Add Deploy key” or “Add User key” depending on which type of key you removed
* This can also be done [via the API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey "https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/createCheckoutKey")

2\. Add a `run` step before your `- checkout` step that installs OpenSSH 7.2 or greater, as an example, this would install OpenSSH 8.1p1:

```yml
jobs:
  jobname:
    docker:
      - image: koalaman/shellcheck-alpine:v0.7.1
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install OpenSSH 8.1p1
          command: |
            sudo apt-get update
            mkdir ~/tempdownload; 
            cd ~/tempdownload; 
            wget https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz; 
            tar zxvf openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz; 
            cd openssh-8.1p1 && ./configure && make && sudo make install
      - checkout
```

3\. If `git` is not installed on the image, you’ll need to install that before the `- checkout` step, an example of doing that here:

```yml
- run:
      name: Install git for checkout
      command: |
          apt-get update && apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install git
```

4\. Swap to a different image, or build a custom image, that has both the proper OpenSSH version and `git` installed -- or one that doesn't have either installed.

## Projects with manually uploaded DSA or RSA SHA1 SSH keys
{: #projects-with-manually-uploaded-dsa-or-rsa-sha1-ssh-keys }
{:.no_toc}

If you [manually uploaded an SSH key]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/add-ssh-key/#overview) to use for checkout purposes, and that key is DSA, you’ll need to update the key to have it continue to work.

You’ll want to generate a new SSH key, [meeting the requirements set forth by GitHub](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/), and add and use that key within CircleCI.

If the key you manually uploaded was RSA SHA1:

1. As long as the docker or machine image you are using is new enough, you’ll be able to continue to use the key. The image needs to have OpenSSH 7.2 or greater installed, you can check using the following command in the job using that image: `- run: ssh -V`
2. Alternatively, if the image you are using is older or you can’t update it, you’ll want to generate a new SSH key, [meeting the requirements set forth by GitHub](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/), and add and use that key within CircleCI.

Mass regeneration of checkout keys

For organizations that have a lot of projects, and the option you are proceeding with is regenerating your keys, we have created a script to help with that process:

<https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/github-ssh-regeneration>

You will want to ensure that the person who runs this script, AKA the personal API key used, has the proper access to generate keys for the repositories. [That likely means an Organization Owner/Admin](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034990033-Am-I-an-Org-Admin-).

<summary>How to view your GitHub webhook deliveries</summary>

Viewing webhooks on GitHub can be a useful diagnostic tool when attempting to discover why perhaps a push to your repo has potentially not resulted in a job on CircleCI.

## What is a webhook?
{: #what-is-a-webhook }
{:.no_toc}

A webhook is what allows CircleCI to automatically take action every time you push a commit. GitHub will send us a packet of information about your project when a number of events occur, a _"_ _push"_ being the most popular.

[GitHub developer docs | Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks)

## How to find your webhooks
{: #how-to-find-your-webhooks }
{:.no_toc}

1. Navigate to your repository's settings page.
2. Select "**Webhooks**"in the left menu. (Alternatively, you can reach this page directly -> _https://github.com/<ORG>/<REPO>/settings/hooks)_
3. You should now see a page similar to the following:

![GH repo settings]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/view_webhook_1.png)

4. From here, click on the CircleCI webhook URL, and scroll down to "**Recent Deliveries**".

![CircleCI webhook url recent deliveries]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/view_webhook_2.png)

5. Click on any entry to view the delivery details. This will show the Headers and Payload of the webhook.

![GH repo settings]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/view_webhook_3.png)

The **X-GitHub-Delivery** value (which is the same as the id you clicked on to open this delivery) is useful for tracking your webhook. Support can use this to do further investigation if needed.

In the **Payload** section under the **SHA** value, you can find the commit hash to ensure the webhook is referring to the correct commit.

You can also check the response back from CircleCI when GitHub sent the response. Switch from the "**Request**" tab to the "**Response**" tab. If you see a "200" response, your WebHook was delivered successfully.

<summary>How to push a commit back to the same repository as part of the CircleCI job</summary>

You may have a use case for creating a new commit and pushing it to the same repository as part of your CircleCI job.

## Configuration Steps
{: #configuration-steps }
{:.no_toc}

Here is how you can configure your CircleCI project to enable the above-mentioned use case.

1) Decide if you wish to configure the project with a user key generated by CircleCI or a manually-created read-write deployment key

1a) If you wish to use a user key, simply visit <https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/ssh>[ ](https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#checkout)and click on the "Authorize with GitHub" button.

1b) If you wish to use a read-write deployment key, follow the steps here to create it and configure the project so that the key has write permissions for it: <{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-github-user-key> or <{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-bitbucket-user-key> for Bitbucket users

## Common Issues:
{: #common-issues }
{:.no_toc}

1) "\*\*\* Please tell me who you are." error message upon running "git commit"

In your CircleCI configuration file (config.yml), you might have to add commands to configure an email and user name with \`git config\` prior to running \`git commit\`, e.g.

git config user.email "username@mydomain.com"  
git config user.name "My Name"


2) Running git push results in "ERROR: The key you are authenticating with has been marked as read only."

The deploy key that the project is configured with, by default when you add a project on CircleCI, only has read access, so a key with write permissions needs to be configured to be used, to avoid the above error message. Please ensure that a user key or a read-write deployment key has been configured for the project (See "Configuration Steps" above).

If you are using a read-write deployment key, please add an [add\_ssh\_keys]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#add%5Fssh%5Fkeys) step to your configuration. The fingerprints value should match what is shown on [https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#ssh](https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#checkout)

3) How to stop your generated commits from triggering new builds

To prevent a commit from triggering a new build, add "\[skip ci\]" to the commit message. For more details, see: <{{site.baseurl}}/2.0/skip-build/#skipping-a-build>

<summary>Troubleshooting CircleCI access after enabling Github SSO</summary>

A GitHub organization owner can[ enable SAML protection](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on) for their org, which requires members to authenticate via SSO (e.g. Okta) before they are able to access any resources associated with that organization. When SSO/SAML protection is enabled, previously issued OAuth tokens for applications such as CircleCI become invalid for that organization, and future user GitHub authentication to CircleCI without an active SAML session will result in a loss of access to protected orgs.

When CircleCI attempts to fetch the `config.yml of a project or read other org resources on behalf of a user, and that user has not authorized access to the SAML-protected org as part of the GitHub OAuth flow (see below), the operation will fail. This can impact UI/API interactions, as well as pipeline creation. In the case of VCS-initiated pipelines, GitHub will show a successful webhook delivery in the repository settings, but CircleCI will not be able to fetch the config and a pipeline will not be created.

The solution to this problem is for the user to revoke their CircleCI credentials in GitHub and then re-authenticate via the login flow (or, for email+password users, by re-connecting their GitHub account in [User Settings](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user) \-> Account Integrations). Follow these steps:

1. Go to your personal OAuth application settings for CircleCI: [CircleCI OAuth App ](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/78a2ba87f071c28e65bb)
2. Click “Revoke access” and confirm.
3. Go to <https://app.circleci.com> and log out if necessary.
4. Log back in to CircleCI via GitHub (), or after logging in via another means (e.g. email+password), re-connect your VCS identity (<https://app.circleci.com/settings/user>)
   1. When prompted, be sure to click “Authorize” for any SAML-protected orgs you need access to
   2. Click “Continue” to be redirected to CircleCI

It’s important to note that CircleCI only stores a _single_ OAuth token for each GitHub user, _regardless_ of how many orgs they interact within CircleCI. This means that, if a user regularly interacts with multiple orgs, and does not want to re-authenticate when switching between them, it is recommended that they authorize SAML-protected orgs on _every_ re-authentication to CircleCI via GitHub, including when switching devices. This will prevent access-related problems arising from that user’s actions on either platform, e.g. failure to create CircleCI pipelines based when pushing commits.

<summary>Permission Denied When Creating Directory or Writing a File</summary>

If you receive an error telling you that you do not have permissions to create a directory or to write a file to a directory then this is likely an indication that your script is attempting to write to a directory that the user running the build does not own.

This is a somewhat common pitfall that many users run into when the move into a CI environment.

The key thing to remember is that the builds run as the `distiller` user on MacOS builds and typically `ubunutu` on Linux builds. These users only have write permissions in their `$HOME` folders and places like `/tmp`. This is not unique to CI, this is true by default in almost all Linux/Unix environments.

To confirm which user your build runs as you can run the `whoami` command as a part of your build process.

Solution

1. Store things inside of a folder that the user running the build has permissions to.
2. Change the ownership of the directory with the `chown` command before trying to write to it.

We recommend the first solution. If you decide to go with the second solution then a command like this should work in both MacOS and Linux builds.

`chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/directory`

`$USER` is a global environment variable that refers to the current logged in user.

`/path/to/directory` should be replaced with the path to where you want to write to.

<summary>How to: Add a user to your account</summary>

When you have a user in your organization who hasn't built on CircleCI before, the first thing they need to do is register on CircleCI. This only involves authenticating their VCS username (GitHub or Bitbucket) on our platform, but this gives CircleCI the permissions to identify the user and associate their builds with them.

CircleCI recognizes users as whomever triggers a build by committing on GitHub. There is no need to assign a seat to the specific user. In order for the new user to claim the added user seat, all they have to do is trigger a build from GitHub. They should then be included on the active user list on your Plan Usage page under the Users tab: app.circleci.com/settings/plan/\[githubORbitbucket\]/\[orgname\]/usage

<summary>Xcode 12.5 - Unable to build chain to self-signed root for signer</summary>

If you are utilizing our macOS executors and building on Xcode 12.5+ and not using Fastlane match for your signing, you may encounter an error that looks like:

Warning: unable to build chain to self-signed root for signer "Apple Development: XXXXXXX"

By default, we have the proper certificates on the image, however, if you aren't using the `setup_circle_ci` task in your Fastfile and [Fastlane match]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/testing-ios/#code-signing-with-fastlane-match) then they won't be properly applied to your build.

You have two options for resolving this issue, the first would be to follow the above documentation and implement Fastlane match.

If the above isn't an option, then you can update your Fastfile to include the following:

```
import_certificate(
certificate_path: "AppleWWDRCAG3.cer",
keychain_path: "/Users/distiller/Library/Keychains/fastlane_tmp_keychain-db",
keychain_password: ""
)
```

Then download the certificate from the following:

<https://developer.apple.com/support/expiration/>

Then include it in the project's root. Afterward, it can be imported into the temp Fastlane keychain.

<summary>fastlane gym failed with "** ARCHIVE FAILED **" error message (exit status 65)</summary>

It is difficult to find out the issue from the above error message alone, as the [exit code 65](https://circleci.com/blog/xcodebuild-exit-code-65-what-it-is-and-how-to-solve-for-ios-and-macos-builds/) is used as a general xcodebuild error code. Hence there could be many reasons why the build failed at the archive step.

You can try the following steps to troubleshoot this problem.

1. Check your [Code Signing setting](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015983028)
2. Check your environment variables. (For example: Build Number) If the build succeeds on your local machine but fails in the CI environment, there could be environment variables defined on the local machine, but not made available to builds on CircleCI, causing the build to fail.
3. Check fastlane's log for more information about why the fastlane command failed. The log may contain details about the root cause of the error, for instance missing provisioning profiles. The log path is printed in the output of the fastlane command, for example: /Users/distiller/driver-application/buildlogs/gym/DriverApplication-DriverApplication.log You could either SSH into a rebuild to access the log or upload the file as an [artifact]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/artifacts/#uploading-artifacts).
4. Check if Xcode SDK version should be defined in the gym configuration in the Fastfile

```
    gym(
      sdk: "iphoneos11.4"
    )
```

(Setting the sdk option results in the -sdk argument being specified in the xcodebuild command that fastlane uses)

<summary>Conditional steps in jobs and conditional workflows</summary>

With the [recent addition of advanced logic in a config file](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/advanced-logic-in-config/36011), the option to conditionally trigger steps in a job or to conditionally trigger a workflow is now available.

[Specific logic statements can be used]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/configuration-reference/#logic-statements) to create multiple nested conditions, that will always at the top level result in `true` or `false` \-- which in turn determines if the workflow or steps are triggered.

### Job Step Example
{: #job-step-example }
{:.no_toc}

```yml
- when:
    condition:
      or:
        - and:
          - equal: [ main, << pipeline.git.branch >> ]
          - or: [ << pipeline.parameters.param1 >>, << pipeline.parameters.param2 >> ]
        - or:
          - equal: [ false, << pipeline.parameters.param1 >> ]
    steps:
      - run: echo "I am on main AND param1 is true OR param2 is true -- OR param1 is false"
```

### Workflow Example
{: #workflow-example }
{:.no_toc}

```yml
workflows:
  conditional-workflow:
    when:
      and: # All must be true to trigger
        - equal: [ main, << pipeline.git.branch >> ]
        - not: << pipeline.parameters.param1 >>
        - or: [ << pipeline.parameters.param1 >>, << pipeline.parameters.param2 >> ]

    jobs:
      - job-on-condition
```

Conditions can be nested in an arbitrary fashion, according to their argument specifications, and to a maximum depth of 100 levels. This allows for some complex logic, as an example of multiple nested conditions:

```yml
- when:
    condition:
      or:
        - and:
          - or:
              - and:
                  - equal: [ main, << pipeline.git.branch >> ]
                  - equal: [ false, << pipeline.parameters.param1 >> ]
              - or:
                  - not: << pipeline.parameters.param3 >>
          - or:
              - equal: [ false, << pipeline.parameters.param3 >> ]
              - or: [ << pipeline.parameters.param1 >>, << pipeline.parameters.param2 >> ]  
        - or:
            - equal: [ true, << pipeline.parameters.param4 >> ]

    steps:
      - run: echo "param 4 is true OR the other nested conditions are true"
```

<details markdown=block>
<summary>Filter workflows by branch</summary>

You can filter your workflows to run on specific branches by adding the **filters** key to the job name in your **workflows** section.

```yml
workflows:  
    build:  
      jobs:  
        - test:  
            filters:  
              branches:  
                only:  
                  - main
```

It can also be used to prevent later jobs unless they are running on a specific branch

```yml
workflows:  
  build:  
    jobs:  
      - test  
      - deploy:  
          requires:  
            - test  
          filters:  
            branches:  
              only:  
                - main

<summary>How to insert files as environment variables with Base64</summary>

If you need to insert sensitive text-based documents or even small binary files into your project in secret it is possible to insert them as an environment variable by leveraging base64 encoding.

[Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) is an encoding scheme to translate binary data into text strings. These values can be added to [a context]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/contexts/) or inserted as [an environment variable]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/env-vars/) and decoded at runtime.

Environment variables can be configured in the UI under "Project Settings":

![project settings env var ]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/troubleshooting_images/base_encode_1.png)

While contexts can be configured under "Organization Settings":

You can encode a file via your command line terminal by feeding it directly to base64.

`base64 [option] [file]`

[Here is the MAN documentation for base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64).

_Note_ If you are encoding a file (whether it be a large file or a "binary") for use as a CircleCI environment variable, you should pass the `-w 0` option to the command so newlines aren't present in the resulting base64, which will be converted to spaces when added to CircleCI.

To then decode the base64 file from within your container you can run the decode option.

`base64 --decode [file]`

If your file is stored as an environment variable, you can pipe it directly to the base64 command to be decoded, storing the result in a file

echo "$ENV_VARIABLE_NAME" | base64 --decode > filename.txt

For more information, you can read about [base64 encoding and decoding variables within a config in our docs]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/env-vars/#encoding-multi-line-environment-variables).

<summary>How to set up a VPN connection during builds</summary>

**In case you need to connect to a private network during your builds, or if you want to restrict access to your environment to a specific IP address, we suggest configuring a VPN connection as follows.**

_**Note that you must use one of the following executors:**_

* [machine](#h%5F01F3THFAZEDDNM5FGE00471E2N)
* [macOS](#h%5F01F3THFMEAY31K30ZKP3M0RVZ7)
* [windows](#h%5F01F7XH9G40MXW14H2GFHRD8XXJ)

* Base64-encode the OpenVPN client configuration file, and store it as an [environment variable]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/env-vars/).
* If the VPN client authentication is credentials-based (user-locked profile), you'll also need to add the username and password as environment variables (`VPN_USER` and `VPN_PASSWORD`).

#### L2TP
{: #l2tp }
{:.no_toc}

To set up an L2TP VPN connection, we recommend referring to [this guide.](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#configure-linux-vpn-clients-using-the-command-line)

We suggest storing `VPN_SERVER_IP`, `VPN_IPSEC_PSK`, `VPN_USER` and `VPN_PASSWORD` as [environment variables]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/env-vars/). Ideally, you might want to base64-encode `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` before storing it; you'll need to decode it during the build.

Also, we suggest storing the default gateway IP address in an environment variable:

* `DEFAULT_GW_IP=$(ip route show default|awk '{print $3}')`

<summary>How to generate and store read/write SSH keys</summary>

If you want to enable write-permissions to your checkout repo within a job, interact with other private repositories entirely, you'll need to add an SSH key to CircleCI which provides write access.

Check out our docs with [with full instructions to generate and add the keys]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/add-ssh-key/)

See GitHub and Bitbucket documentation for guidelines on storing SSH public keys:

* <https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys>

<summary>Why aren't pull requests triggering jobs on my organization?</summary>

**If you revoked OAuth access to CircleCI on your VCS provider (GitHub, BitBucket)**

If you revoke OAuth access to the CircleCI app on your VCS provider it will disable the keys that we used to authorize your account. We do not receive notifications when the auth is revoked, and may still attempt to use the now revoked auth. For instance, you may encounter this when trying to submit a PR to an open source project that uses CircleCI and it does not trigger. If you encounter this issue [submit a support ticket](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can resolve it for you.


**If you're following the fork instead of the upstream repo**

Sometimes you'll have a user who submits a pull request to your repository from a fork, but no pipeline will be triggered with the pull request. This can happen when the user is following the project fork on their personal account rather than the project itself on CircleCI.

This will cause the jobs to trigger under the user's personal account. If the user is following a fork of the repository on CircleCI, we will only build on that fork and not the parent, so the parent’s PR will not get status updates.

In these cases have the user unfollow their fork of the project on CircleCI and follow the source project instead. This will trigger their jobs to run under the organization when they submit pull requests.

**Note: This feature is not currently supported for BitBucket users.**

**If the branch and the pull request happen to be created simultaneously**

You might experience builds that are pull requests not running with the error message "This project is configured to only run builds that have open pull requests associated with them. Update the ['Only build pull requests'](https://circleci.com/gh/UrbanCompass/uc-frontend/edit#advanced-settings) setting to run this build."

This happens due to a race condition when a branch is created and a pull request is opened simultaneously. CircleCI will receive notification the branch was created, and will not run the build because it is not a pull request.

We will then receive a second notification of a pull request being opened, with the same commit hash. Since we will never run the same commit hash twice, the build is updated in the UI, but never ran.

To ensure this doesn't happen to builds with "Only build pull requests" turned on, you can disable the "Branch or tag creation" setting in Github. This will ensure that the only webhooks we receive are when the pull request is open.

<summary>Build Fails with "Too long with no output (exceeded 10m0s): context deadline exceeded"</summary>

In CircleCI, a command will be killed if a certain period of time has passed with no output. By default, this is 10 minutes. This is designed to prevent errors in builds from hanging using a large number of credits unintentionally.

Some test runners and tools make use of what is known as output buffering. This is where the program will wait to output text in batches as opposed to line by line. Sometimes, all output will be buffered until the process exits. If a test or task requires more than 10 minutes and is buffering its output, this can cause CircleCI to kill the step as there has been no output during that time

In Python, this can be sometimes be disabled via the [PYTHONUNBUFFERED](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED) environment variable. This can be set in a job step via export:

```yml
steps:  
  - run:  
      name: Run Tests  
      command: |  
        export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  
        python -m unittest
```

If the task does not have a way to generate any output, the default context deadline can be increased

```yml
steps:  
 - run:  
     name: Run Tests  
     no_output_timeout: 30m  
     command: python -m unittest
```

The job step can also timeout because there is an issue with the tests or task is actually hanging. Some examples of causes of this would be where a process is waiting for user input or a loop is polling a network resource that never comes available.

<summary>How to `sudo` on Powershell - Windows executor</summary>

Windows Powershell doesn't have `sudo` \- some commands needs to be run as an administrator Powershell has no concept of it.

One solution we can use is `Start-Process` command: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process> The following line is the example of this command.

Start-Process wpr -verb runAs -Args "-start GeneralProfile"

This is calling `wpr` (Windows Performance Recorder) as an administrator and passing necessary arguments with `-Args` flag. However in this case, the challenge is that we don't see the output because theoretically, since it starts a new shell somewhere.

The other way you can think is scoop (<https://scoop.sh/>) which enables the commands equivalent to the one in Linux. You can install by following way:

iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')  
set-executionpolicy unrestricted -s cu -f  
scoop install sudo

By installing this, you can use `sudo` just like you're in Linux. However with this, it's basically doing the same thing with the above so it's not possible to see the output anyway. (You can see the script inside here: <https://github.com/lukesampson/psutils/blob/master/sudo.ps1>)
