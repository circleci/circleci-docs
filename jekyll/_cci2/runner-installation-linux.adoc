This page describes how to install CircleCI runner on Linux. 

NOTE: Please review the xref:runner-installation.adoc[Installing the CircleCI Runner] page to verify prerequisites and authentication.

== Create the CircleCI runner configuration

The recommended CircleCI runner configuration for Linux is:

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation. For example,
  # url: https://circleci.example.com

runner:
  name: RUNNER_NAME
  command_prefix: ["sudo", "-niHu", "circleci", "--"]
  working_directory: /opt/circleci/workdir/%s
  cleanup_working_directory: true
```

Replace `AUTH_TOKEN` with the token created in the xref:runner-installation.adoc#authentication[Authentication] step. `RUNNER_NAME` can be anything you would like although should be unique among all other runners used by the same resource class.

== Install the CircleCI runner configuration

Once created, save the configuration file to `/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml` owned by `root` with permissions `600`:

```bash
sudo chown root: /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
sudo chmod 600 /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

== Create the circleci user & working directory

These will be used when executing the task agent. These commands must be run as a user with permissions to create other users (e.g. `root`). For information about GECOS, see the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field[wiki page].

=== Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
id -u circleci &>/dev/null || sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos GECOS circleci

sudo mkdir -p /opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chown -R circleci /opt/circleci/workdir
```

=== CentOS/RHEL

```bash
id -u circleci &>/dev/null || sudo adduser -c GECOS circleci

sudo mkdir -p /opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chown -R circleci /opt/circleci/workdir
```

== Configure SELinux policy (RHEL 8)

An SELinux policy is required for runner to accept and launch jobs on RHEL 8 systems (earlier versions of RHEL are unsupported). Note that this policy does not add any permissions to the ones that may be required by individual jobs on this runner install.

Create directory `/opt/circleci/policy` and generate the initial policy module:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/circleci/policy

# Install sepolicy and rpmbuild if you haven't already
sudo yum install -y policycoreutils-devel
sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo sepolicy generate --path /opt/circleci/policy --init /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent
```

Download the following type enforcing file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te[`circleci_launch_agent.te`] and install the policy:

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te --output /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.te

sudo /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.sh
```

== Optional Steps

=== Enable the `systemd` unit

Create `/opt/circleci/circleci.service` owned by `root` with permissions `755`.

You must ensure that `TimeoutStopSec` is greater than the total amount of time a task will run for - which defaults to 5 hours.

If you want to configure the CircleCI runner installation to start on boot, it is important to note that the launch agent will attempt to consume and start jobs as soon as it starts, so it should be configured appropriately before starting. The launch agent may be configured as a service and be managed by `systemd` with the following scripts:

```
[Unit]
Description=CircleCI Runner
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
Restart=always
User=root
NotifyAccess=exec
TimeoutStopSec=18300
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

You can now enable the service:

```bash
systemctl enable /opt/circleci/circleci.service
```

=== Start the service

When the CircleCI runner service starts, it will immediately attempt to start running jobs, so it should be fully configured before the first start of the service.

```bash
systemctl start circleci.service
```

=== Verify the service is running

The system reports a very basic health status through the `status` field in `systemctl`. This will report **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** based on connectivity to the CircleCI APIs.

You can see the status of the agent by running:

```bash
systemctl status circleci.service --no-pager
```

Which should produce output similar to:

```
circleci.service - CircleCI Runner
   Loaded: loaded (/opt/circleci/circleci.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-05-29 14:33:31 UTC; 18min ago
 Main PID: 5592 (circleci-launch)
   Status: "Healthy"
    Tasks: 8 (limit: 2287)
   CGroup: /system.slice/circleci.service
           └─5592 /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

You can also see the logs for the system by running:

```bash
journalctl -u circleci
```
