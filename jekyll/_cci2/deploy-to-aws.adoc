In this how-to guide, you will learn how to configure CircleCI to deploy to Amazon Web Services.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

This page covers deployment to S3, ECR/ECS (Elastic Container Registry/Elastic Container Service), as well as application deployment using AWS Code Deploy.

For more detailed information about the AWS S3, ECS, ECR, and CodeDeploy orbs, refer to the following orb registry pages:

* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-s3[AWS S3]
* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecr[AWS ECR]
* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecs[AWS ECS]
* link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-code-deploy[AWS CodeDeploy]

In addition to the orb described below, CircleCI has created an AWS convenience image focusing on deployment, link:https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/aws[cimg/aws].

[#deploy-to-s3-using-the-aws-s3-orb]
== Deploy to S3 using the AWS S3 orb

For detailed information about the AWS S3 orb, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-s3[CircleCI AWS S3 Orb Reference] page. This section details the use of the AWS S3 orb and `version: 2.1` configuration for simple deployment, below we will look at the same example without orbs and using using `version: 2` configuration.

[#create-iam-user]
=== 1. Create IAM user

For security best practice, create a new link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/manage-users/[IAM user] specifically for CircleCI.

[#add-aws-access-keys]
=== 2. Add AWS access keys

Add your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[AWS access keys] to CircleCI – store your Access Key ID in a variable called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and your Secret Access Key in a variable called `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

[#deploy-using-orb]
=== 3. Deploy using orb

Use the orb's `sync` command to deploy. Note the use of workflows to deploy only if the `build` job passes and the current branch is `main`.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@3.1.1 # use the AWS S3 orb in your configuration

workflows: # Define a Workflow running the build job, then the deploy job
  build-deploy: # Make a workflow to build and deploy your project
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build # Only run deploy job once the build job has completed
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main # Only deploy when the commit is on the Main branch

jobs: # Define the build and deploy jobs
  build:
    docker: # Use the Docker executor for the build job
      - image: <image-name-and-tag> # Specify the Docker image to use for the build job
    steps:
      - checkout # build job steps omitted for brevity
  deploy:
    docker: # Use the Docker executor for the deploy job
      - image: <image-name-and-tag>  # Specify the Docker image to use for the deploy job
    steps:
      - checkout
      - aws-s3/sync:
          from: bucket
          to: 's3://my-s3-bucket-name/prefix'
          arguments: | # Optional arguments
            --acl public-read \
            --cache-control "max-age=86400"
```

[#deploy-to-aws-s3-with-2-configuration]
== Deploy to S3 with 2.0 configuration

[#create-iam-user-2]
=== 1. Create IAM user

For security best practice, create a new link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/manage-users/[IAM user] specifically for CircleCI.

[#add-aws-access-keys-2]
=== 2. Add AWS access keys

Add your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[AWS access keys] to CircleCI – store your Access Key ID in a variable called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and your Secret Access Key in a variable called `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

[#create-deploy-job]
=== 3. Create deploy job

In your `.circleci/config.yml` file, create a new `deploy` job. In the `deploy` job, add a step to install `awscli` in your primary container.

[#install-awscli]
=== 4. Install the AWS CLI

Install `awscli` in your primary container by following the link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[AWS CLI documentation].

[#deploy-awscli]
=== 5. Deploy with the AWS CLI

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-using.html[Use the AWS CLI] to deploy your application to S3 or perform other AWS operations. Note the use of workflows to deploy only if the build job passes and the current branch is `main`.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows: # Define a Workflow running the build job, then the deploy job
    build-deploy:
    jobs:
        - build
        - deploy:
            requires:
            - build
            filters:
            branches:
                only: main # Only deploys when the commit is on the Main branch

jobs:
    build:
    docker: # Specify executor for running build job - this example uses a Docker container
        - image: <docker-image-name-tag> # Specify docker image to use
          auth:
            username: mydockerhub-user
            password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    ... # build job steps omitted for brevity
    deploy:
    docker: # Specify executor for running deploy job
        - image: <docker-image-name-tag> # Specify docker image to use
          auth:
            username: mydockerhub-user
            password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
        - run: # Install the AWS CLI if it is not already included in the docker image
            name: Install awscli
            command: sudo pip install awscli
        - run: # Deploy to S3 using the sync command
            name: Deploy to S3
            command: aws s3 sync <path/to/bucket> <s3://location/in/S3-to-deploy-to>
```

For a complete list of AWS CLI commands and options, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/[AWS CLI Command Reference].

[#deploy-docker-image-to-aws-ecr]
== Deploy Docker image to AWS ECR

The AWS ECR orb enables you to log into AWS, build, and then push a Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry with minimal config. See the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecr[orb registry page] for a full list of parameters, jobs, commands and options.

Using the `build-and-push-image` job (shown below) requires the following env vars to be set: `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_URL`, `ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-ecr: circleci/aws-ecr@x.y.z # Use the AWS ECR orb in your configuration

workflows:
  build_and_push_image:
    jobs:
      - aws-ecr/build-and-push-image: # Use the pre-defined `build-and-push-image` job
          dockerfile: <my-Docker-file>
          path: <path-to-my-Docker-file>
          profile-name: <my-profile-name>
          repo: <my-ECR-repo>
          tag: <my-ECR-repo-tag> # default - latest
```

[#update-an-aws-ecs-instance]
== Update an AWS ECS instance

Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecr[AWS ECR] and link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecs[ECS] orbs to easily update an existing AWS ECS instance.

Using the `build-and-push-image` job (shown below) requires the following env vars to be set: `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_URL`, `ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-ecr: circleci/aws-ecr@x.y.z # Use the AWS ECR orb in your configuration
  aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@x.y.z # Use the AWS ECS orb in your configuration

workflows:
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - aws-ecr/build-and-push-image:
          dockerfile: <my-Docker-file>
          path: <path-to-my-Docker-file>
          profile-name: <my-profile-name>
          repo: ${MY_APP_PREFIX}
          tag: '${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
      - aws-ecs/deploy-service-update:
          requires:
            - aws-ecr/build-and-push-image # only run the deployment job once the build and push image job has completed
          family: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service'
          cluster: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster'
          container-image-name-updates: 'container=${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service,tag=${CIRCLE_SHA1}'
```

[#aws-codedeploy]
== AWS CodeDeploy

The link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-code-deploy[AWS CodeDeploy] orb enables you to run deployments through AWS CodeDeploy.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1 # use 2.1 to make use of orbs and pipelines

orbs:
  aws-code-deploy: circleci/aws-code-deploy@x.y.z # Use the AWS CodeDeploy orb in your configuration

workflows:
  deploy_application:
    jobs:
      - aws-code-deploy/deploy:
          application-name: <my-application> # The name of an AWS CodeDeploy application associated with the applicable IAM user or AWS account.
          deployment-group: <my-deployment-group> # The name of a new deployment group for the specified application.
          service-role-arn: <my-deployment-group-role-ARN> # The service role for a deployment group.
          bundle-bucket: <my-application-S3-bucket> # The s3 bucket where an application revision will be stored.
          bundle-key: <my-S3-bucket-key> # A key under the s3 bucket where an application revision will be stored.
```
