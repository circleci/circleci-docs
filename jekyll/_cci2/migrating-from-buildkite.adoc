This document provides an overview of how to migrate from Buildkite to CircleCI. 

NOTE: **Tips provided by ImagineX Consulting**

== Source Control Setup
First you will need to ensure your source code is located in either to GitHub or BitBucket. See the following for details on how to import your code:

* https://help.github.com/en/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer[GitHub]
* https://help.github.com/en/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer[BitBucket]

=== GitHub Enterprise

Following are the steps required for using the git command line tool to import your code into GitHub Enterprise:

. Create an empty repository on your GitHub Enterprise instance.
. Create a bare clone of your external repository on your local machine, fetching all remote tags (refs/tags/\*) and copying all remote branch heads (refs/heads/\*) directly to their corresponding local branch heads.
+
----
git clone https://external-host.com/extuser/repo.git --bare
----
. Add your GitHub Enterprise repository as a remote reference in your local clone.
+
----
cd [repo-name]
git remote add enterprise git@[hostname]:[owner]/[repo-name].git
----
. Push all local references (refs/*) up to your remote GitHub Enterprise repository.
+
----
git push enterprise --mirror
----

Once you have imported your code into GitHub or BitBucket, you can start creating a project in CircleCI using the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/[Getting Started guide].


== Build Configuration

Next, you'll need to migrate your build configuration. On Buildkite, the build configuration is either defined in the web interface or in a file called `.pipeline.yml` in the root directory of your source code repository. If you use shell scripts to perform your build, you can reuse those scripts in CircleCI.

First, create a CircleCI build configuration file. In the root directory of your source code repository, create a folder named .circleci and create a file in that folder named config.yml. Next, follow the CircleCI documentation here to learn how to configure the .config.yml file.

The Buildkite and CircleCI configurations will be different. It may be helpful to have both Buildkite and CircleCI reference documentation open side-by-side to help with the conversion of the build steps:

* https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/defining-steps[Buildkite Pipeline Reference]

* https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/[CircleCI YML Reference]


Some differences that are worth calling out:

For larger and more complex build files, we recommend moving over the build steps in phases until you get comfortable with the CircleCI platform. We recommend this order:

. Execution of shell scripts and Docker compose files
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/[Workflows]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/[Artifacts]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/[Caching]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/triggers/#section=jobs[Triggers]
. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/optimizations/#section=projects[Performance options]
