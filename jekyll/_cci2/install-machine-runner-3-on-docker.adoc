This page describes how to install CircleCI's machine runner 3.0 with the Docker executor. If you are looking to set up self-hosted runners in a private Kubernetes cluster, visit the <<container-runner-installation#,Container runner>> page.

[NOTE]
====
xref:container-runner#[Container runner] is the **recommended method** for self-hosted runner Docker installation. The instructions on this page are for a simple Docker setup using machine runner 3.0.

Container runner is the recommended approach for running containerized jobs on self-hosted runners. Container runner offers the ability to seamlessly define, publish, and use custom Docker images during job execution, as well as the ability to manage dependencies or libraries through custom Docker images instead of enumerating dependencies as part of `steps` in the `.circleci/config.yml` file.

[#machine-runner-prerequsites]
=== Prerequisites

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker]

[#resource-requirements]
==== Resource requirements

The host needs to have Docker installed. Once the `runner` container is started, the container will immediately attempt to start running jobs. The container will be reused to run more jobs indefinitely until it is stopped.

The number of containers running in parallel on the host is constrained by the host's available resources and your jobs' performance requirements.

=== Self-hosted runner terms agreement

{% include snippets/runner/terms.adoc %}

[#create-namespace-and-resource-class]
=== 1. Create namespace and resource class

{% include snippets/runner/install-with-cli-steps.adoc %}

=== 2. Create a Dockerfile that extends the machine runner 3.0 image

Create a `Dockerfile.runner.extended` file. In this example, Python 3 is installed on top of the base image.

```dockerfile
FROM circleci/runner-agent:machine-3
RUN sudo apt-get update; \
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
        python3
```

[#build-the-docker-image]
=== 3. Build the Docker image

```shell
docker build --file ./Dockerfile.runner.extended .
```

[#start-the-docker-container]
=== 4. Start the Docker container

NOTE: The environment variable values are not available to the `docker` command, so these environment variables are not visible in `ps` output.

[.tab.startContainer.Cloud]
--
```shell
CIRCLECI_RUNNER_NAME=<runner-name> CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_AUTH_TOKEN=<runner-token> docker run --env CIRCLECI_RUNNER_NAME --env CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_AUTH_TOKEN --name <container-name> <image-id-from-previous-step>
```
--

[.tab.startContainer.Server]
--
When starting the Docker container on server, the `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL` environment variable will also need to be passed in using the `--env` flag.

```shell
CIRCLECI_RUNNER_NAME=<runner-name> CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_AUTH_TOKEN=<runner-token> CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL=<server_host_name> docker run --env CIRCLECI_RUNNER_NAME --env CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_AUTH_TOKEN --env CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL --name <container-name> <image-id-from-previous-step>
```
--

When the container starts, it will immediately attempt to start running jobs.

[#stopping-the-docker-container]
=== Stopping the Docker container

```shell
docker stop <container-name>
```

[#remove-the-docker-container]
=== Remove the Docker container

In some cases you might need to fully remove a stopped machine runner container from the system, such as when recreating a container using the same name.

```shell
docker stop <container-name>; docker rm <container-name>;
```

[#migrating-from-launch-agent]
=== Migrating from launch agent

NOTE: In machine runner 3.0, the environment variable name prefix has changed from `LAUNCH_AGENT_` to `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_`.

To migrate from launch agent to machine runner 3.0 on Docker, stop and remove the launch agent containers and replace them with machine runner 3.0 containers, using the commands described above.
