Pipelines are triggered in response to actions or scheduled to run at specific times and frequencies. Each method of triggering a pipeline is described below.

[#run-a-pipeline-on-commit-to-your-code-repository]
== Trigger a pipeline on push to your code repository

Once a project is hooked up to CircleCI, a pipeline is triggered each time a commit is pushed on a branch that has a `.circleci/config.yml` file included. Once the commit is pushed the running pipeline appears on the pipelines dashboard, which is accessible by selecting **Dashboard** from the left hand sidebar in the CircleCI web app.

[#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app]
== Trigger a pipeline from the CircleCI web app

NOTE: This feature is not yet available for GitLab or GitHub App accounts. To find out which GitHub account type you have, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

In the CircleCI web app, when you have a specific branch selected, the **Trigger Pipeline** button becomes enabled:

. Select your branch using the branch filter at the top of the dashboard.

. Select **Trigger Pipeline**. At this point you can choose whether you want to specify any pipeline parameters.
+

. Select **Trigger Pipeline** again (or **Cancel**) and you will see your new pipeline start.

[#run-a-pipeline-using-the-api]
== Trigger a pipeline using the API

NOTE: Triggering a pipeline via the CircleCI v2 API is not currently supported for GitLab projects.

[.tab.apitrigger.GitHub_OAuth_app_/_Bitbucket_Cloud]
--
For **projects integrated with GitHub OAuth app or Bitbucket Cloud**, you can trigger a pipeline for a project using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[Trigger a New Pipeline] endpoint.

. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  <<api-developers-guide#authentication-and-authorization,API Developers Guide>>.

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details, VCS can be `gh` or `bb`:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<VCS>/<your-vcs-org-or-username>/<your-repo-name>/pipeline \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"branch":"<your-branch-name>"}'
----

. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.

TIP: You can also specify pipeline parameters when triggering a pipeline using the API. For full details, see the https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[API v2 Docs].
--

[.tab.apitrigger.GitHub_App_/_Bitbucket_Data_Center]
--
For **projects integrated with GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center**, you can trigger a pipeline for a project using the endpoint `https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline/run`.

NOTE: This endpoint is currently in preview, and is not yet documented in the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html[official API V2 documentation].

. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  <<api-developers-guide#authentication-and-authorization,API Developers Guide>>. Here you will find instructions on how to find your project slug.

. To retrieve the **Definition ID** for the **Pipeline** you want to run, navigate to your project's **Project Settings**, and select **Pipelines** in the sidebar. In the column **Definition ID**, select btn:[Copy] for the correct Pipeline.

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details. The key `parameters` is optional:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/circleci/<org-id>/<project-id>/pipeline/run \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "definition-id": "<pipeline-definition-id>",
  "config": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "checkout": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "parameters": {"<param-name>": "<param-value>"}
  }'
----

. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-a-custom-webhook]
== Trigger a pipeline from a custom webhook

Follow these steps to set up and test a custom webhook trigger for a pipeline from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command:

{% include snippets/custom-webhook-setup.adoc %}

. You can now test your custom webhook trigger with `curl`. To trigger your pipeline, copy and paste the following sample request and replace `<your-URL>` and `<your-secret>` with the URL and secret that you generated in the previous step:
+
NOTE: When triggering via `curl`, you must use a `POST` request with `content-type: application/json`.
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" 'https://internal.circleci.com/private/soc/e/<your-URL>?secret=<your-secret>'
----

For more information on using custom and outbound webhooks, see the xref:webhooks#[Use webhooks to integrate with services] page. Also, see our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-pipelines-from-anywhere-inbound-webhooks-now-in-preview/49864[community forum] for more details or how to use this functionality with a link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/re-build-automatically-when-new-image-is-available-on-dockerhub/50350[3rd party service like DockerHub].

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-vs-code-with-unversioned-config]
== Trigger a pipeline from VS Code with unversioned config

NOTE: The ability to trigger a pipeline from VS Code with an _unversioned_ config is currently in **Open Preview**.

Trigger pipelines from VS Code to iterate on your CircleCI config without committing your trial and error changes to your version control system. Run and validate your full pipeline, or select jobs and workflows to validate individually. View the results of your test runs in the extension pipelines panel or in the CircleCI web app, just the same as any other pipeline.

For full details, see the xref:vs-code-extension-overview#test-run-your-config-from-vs-code[VS Code extension overview].

[#schedule-a-pipeline]
== Schedule a pipeline

NOTE: Scheduling a pipeline is not currently supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center projects. To find out if you authorized through the GitHub OAuth app or the CircleCI GitHub App, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

For non GitLab/GitHub App/Bitbucket Data Center projects, scheduled pipelines allow you to trigger pipelines periodically based on a schedule. To get this set up for a project you can either use the CircleCI web app or use the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/createSchedule[API v2]. For full details of both methods see the <<scheduled-pipelines#,Scheduled Pipelines>> docs.
