= Trigger a pipeline
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:
:icons: font
:experimental:

Pipelines are triggered in response to actions or scheduled to run at specific times and frequencies. Each method of triggering a pipeline is described below.

[#run-a-pipeline-on-commit-to-your-code-repository]
== Trigger a pipeline on a repo event

Trigger a pipeline on an event in your repository. The options available to you will be different depending on which integration you have set up, and for GitHub accounts, which GitHub authentication method you use. For steps to add a trigger for a project, see the xref:pipelines#add-a-trigger[Pipelines and triggers] page.

[tab.event-trigger.GitHub]
--
include::../_includes/partials/tips/check-github-type-org.adoc[]

Using the CircleCI **GitHub App**, you can set up multiple pipelines for a project. For each pipeline you have a selection of trigger event options including push events and non-push events, for example, PR opened/Pr merged/PR marked ready for review. For a full list of options, see the xref:github-trigger-event-options#[GitHub trigger event options] page.

To access trigger options for a pipeline, follow these steps:

include::../_includes/partials/app-navigation/steps-to-project-settings.adoc[]
. Select **Triggers** in the sidebar.
. Select the pencil (icon:pencil[pencil icon]) edit icon next to the trigger you want to update.,
. Use the "Run on" menu to select a trigger event option.
+

If you only use the **GitHub OAuth** integration, once a project is set up in CircleCI, a pipeline is triggered each time a commit is pushed on a branch that has a `.circleci/config.yml` file included. One exception to this is if you use the "Only build pull requests" option. For more information on "Only build pull requests", see the xref:oss#[Build open source projects] page.

TIP: If your org uses the **GitHub OAuth** integration, you can install the GitHub App into your org to set up GitHub App pipelines and access the trigger options described above. An org admin must take the one-time action of installing the CircleCI GitHub App to enable this functionality. For more information, see the xref:github-integration#installing-github-app-alongside-github-oauth-app[GitHub OAuth integration overview].
--

[tab.event-trigger.GitLab]
--
When you create a GitLab project in CircleCI you can set up multiple pipelines and triggers. The default trigger option is to build on every push to your repo. Select from a list or configure a combination of trigger options to control when each pipeline will trigger. You can choose from a selection of supported GitLab events. For a full list of options, see the xref:gitlab-trigger-options#[GitLab trigger options] page.
--

[tab.event-trigger.BitBucket_Cloud]
--
Once your Bitbucket Cloud project is set up in CircleCI, a pipeline is triggered each time a commit is pushed on a branch that has a `.circleci/config.yml` file included. One exception to this is if you use the "Only build pull requests" option. For more information on "Only build pull requests", see the xref:oss#[Build open source projects] page.
--

[tab.event-trigger.BitBucket_Data_Center]
--
When you in create a Bitbucket Data Center project on CircleCI, you will create a pipeline and trigger. Your pipeline will trigger on every push to your repo for branches that include your CircleCI config file.
--

Once triggered, a running pipeline appears on the pipelines dashboard, which is accessible by selecting **Dashboard** from the left hand sidebar in the CircleCI web app.

[#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app]
== Trigger a pipeline from the CircleCI web app

NOTE: This feature is not available for GitLab integrations.

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home[CircleCI web app], select your organization from your homepage, then select your project, either from your org homepage or select **Projects** from the sidebar for a full list. You will now be on your project's pipelines page.

. Select btn:[Trigger Pipeline].
+
image::trigger-pipeline-app.png[Screenshot showing location on trigger pipeline button in the CircleCI web app]

. Select the pipeline you want to trigger from the dropdown menu.

. Select your config source branch. This tells CircleCI where (repo and branch) to find your pipeline config.
+
image::trigger-pipeline-app-modal.png[Trigger a pipeline modal in the CircleCI web app]

. If your code is integrated via the **GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center**, select your checkout source and branch. This tells CircleCI which code to check out when running a xref:configuration-reference#checkout[`checkout` step].
+
TIP: If your code is integrated via **GitHub OAuth or Bitbucket Cloud**, you can skip this step, the same location is used for both config and checkout source.

. If you would like to specify any pipeline parameters, select **Add +** and enter the required fields.

. Select **Run Pipeline** and you will see your new pipeline running in the web app.

NOTE: If your GitHub user account connection to CircleCI is not yet authorized, you will need to select btn:[Authorize] in the trigger pipeline modal to connect and continue.

// @Rosie, is it worth adding an image here?

[#run-a-pipeline-using-the-api]
== Trigger a pipeline using the API

NOTE: Triggering a pipeline via the CircleCI v2 API is not currently supported for GitLab projects.

[.tab.trigger-pipeline-api.GitHub_and_Bitbucket]
--
This method is supported for GitHub (OAuth and App) and Bitbucket (Cloud and Data Center) orgs.

TIP: **GitHub OAuth and Bitbucket Cloud pipelines** can also be triggered using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[Trigger a New Pipeline] endpoint, which is described in the **CircleCI server** tab. However, the method outlined in this section is recommended.

Trigger a pipeline for a project using the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#tag/Pipeline/operation/triggerPipelineRun[v2 API endpoint] `https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<project-slug>/pipeline/run`.

. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  <<api-developers-guide#authentication-and-authorization,API Developers Guide>>.

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[CircleCI web app] select your organization. Over the next few steps you will collect the data you need to trigger your pipeline.

. Find your project slug:
.. Select **Projects** in the CircleCI web app sidebar.
.. Find your project.
.. Select the ellipsis menu (icon:ellipsis-h[ellipsis]) and choose **Project Settings**.
.. Copy your project slug. Save this somewhere, you will need it later.

. Find your definition ID:
.. You should be in project settings if you are following these steps in sequence. If not see previous steps to get there. Select **Pipelines** in the sidebar.
.. In the column **Definition ID**, select btn:[Copy] for the correct pipeline. Save this somewhere, you will need it in the next step.
+
image::triggers/copy-pipeline-definition-id.png[screenshot showing location of pipeline definition ID copy button]

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details. The key `parameters` is optional:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/<project-slug>/pipeline/run \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "definition_id": "<pipeline-definition-id>",
  "config": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "checkout": {"branch": "<your-branch-name>"},
  "parameters": {"<param-name>": "<param-value>"}
  }'
----

. To run a pipeline based on a **tag** instead of a **branch**, replace the `config` and/or `checkout` fields with:
+
[source,shell]
----
  "config": {"tag": "<your-tag-name>"},
  "checkout": {"tag": "<your-tag-name>"}
----
. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.
--

[.tab.trigger-pipeline-api.CircleCI_server]
--
. If you have not already, get set up to use API v2 by following the steps in the  <<api-developers-guide#authentication-and-authorization,API Developers Guide>>.

. To trigger a pipeline from the command line using `curl`, copy and paste this sample request and replace the details in `< >` with your details, VCS can be `gh` or `bb`:
+
NOTE: If you are using CircleCI cloud, `<your-circleci-hostname>` should be `circleci.com`.
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://<your-circleci-hostname>/api/v2/project/<VCS>/<your-vcs-org-or-username>/<your-repo-name>/pipeline \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"branch":"<your-branch-name>"}'
----

. Head back to the CircleCI web app and see your pipeline running on the dashboard.

TIP: You can also specify pipeline parameters when triggering a pipeline using the API. For full details, see the https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[API v2 Docs].

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-a-custom-webhook]
== Trigger a pipeline from a custom webhook

NOTE: Custom webhooks are available for projects integrated via the GitHub App. Custom webhooks are not available on CircleCI server.

Follow these steps to set up and test a custom webhook trigger for a pipeline from anywhere that can emit a webhook or run a curl command:

{% include snippets/custom-webhook-setup.adoc %}

. You can now test your custom webhook trigger with `curl`. To trigger your pipeline, copy and paste the following sample request and replace `<your-URL>` and `<your-secret>` with the URL and secret that you generated in the previous step:
+
NOTE: When triggering via `curl`, you must use a `POST` request with `content-type: application/json`.
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" 'https://internal.circleci.com/private/soc/e/<your-URL>?secret=<your-secret>'
----

For more information on using custom and outbound webhooks, see the xref:webhooks#[Use webhooks to integrate with services] page. Also, see our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/trigger-pipelines-from-anywhere-inbound-webhooks-now-in-preview/49864[community forum] for more details or how to use this functionality with a link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/re-build-automatically-when-new-image-is-available-on-dockerhub/50350[3rd party service like DockerHub].

[#trigger-a-pipeline-from-vs-code-with-unversioned-config]
== Trigger a pipeline from VS Code with unversioned config

NOTE: The ability to trigger a pipeline from VS Code with an _unversioned_ config is currently in **Open Preview**.

Trigger pipelines from VS Code to iterate on your CircleCI config without committing your trial and error changes to your version control system. Run and validate your full pipeline, or select jobs and workflows to validate individually. View the results of your test runs in the extension pipelines panel or in the CircleCI web app, just the same as any other pipeline.

For full details, see the xref:vs-code-extension-overview#test-run-your-config-from-vs-code[VS Code extension overview].

[#schedule-a-pipeline]
== Schedule a pipeline

include::../_includes/partials/notes/standalone-unsupported.adoc[This feature is not supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center]

For non GitLab/GitHub App/Bitbucket Data Center projects, scheduled pipelines allow you to trigger pipelines periodically based on a schedule. To get this set up for a project you can either use the CircleCI web app or use the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/createSchedule[API v2]. For full details of both methods see the <<scheduled-pipelines#,Scheduled Pipelines>> docs.
