WARNING: This feature is in **preview**, use at your own risk. This feature is not guaranteed to move to general availability. For questions and/or issues, please comment on our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Community forum].

[#motivation-and-introduction]
== Motivation and introduction

CircleCI is releasing new preview functionality to **re-run failed tests only**. When selecting this option (see image below), only a subset of tests are re-run, instead of re-running the entire test suite when a transient test failure arises.

Historically, when your testing job in a workflow has flaky tests, the only option to get to a successful workflow was to link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050303671-How-To-Rerun-a-Workflow[re-run your workflow from failed]. This type of re-run executes *all tests* from your testing job, including tests that passed, which prolongs time-to-feedback and consumes credits unnecessarily.

This re-run failed tests only re-runs failed tests from the _same_ commit, not new ones.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Your testing job in the workflow is configured to xref:collect-test-data/#[upload test results] to CircleCI. `filename` or `classname` attributes **must be present** in the xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#junit-xml-reports[JUnit XML output].
* The testing job uses `circleci tests run` (see below for details) to execute tests.
+
NOTE: If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` (see below for instructions).

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

[#example-config-file-before]
=== Before: Example `.circleci/config.yml` file

```yaml
 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py" | circleci tests split --split-by=timings) 
      pytest -o --junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml $TEST_FILES
      
- store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

This example snippet is from a CircleCI configuration file that:

. Executes Python test files that end in `.py`, 
. Splits tests by previous timing results (you can follow xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[this tutorial] on intelligent test splitting), 
. Stores the test results in a new directory called `test-results`, and 
. Uploads those test results to CircleCI.  

**Note:** `-o --junit_family=legacy` is present to ensure that the test results being generated contain the `filename` attribute. Not included in this snippet is the key to set parallelism (read the xref:parallelism-faster-jobs#[Test splitting and parallelism] page for more information).

[#example-config-file-after]
=== After: Example `.circleci/config.yml` file

In the snippet below, the example has been updated to use the `circleci tests run` command to allow for re-running only failed tests.

```yaml
 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py")
      echo $TEST_FILES | circleci tests run --command="xargs pytest -o --junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml" --verbose --split-by=timings

 - store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

* `TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py")`
+
Use CircleCI's xref:troubleshoot-test-splitting#video-troubleshooting-globbing[glob command] to put together a list of test files. In this case, we are looking for any test file that starts with `test_` and ends with `.py`.
  
* `echo $TEST_FILES |`
+
Pass the list of test files to the `circleci tests run` command as standard input (link:https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/stdin.htm[`stdin`]).

* `circleci tests run --command="xargs pytest -o --junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml" --verbose --split-by=timings`
  ** Invoke `circleci tests run` and specify the original command (`pytest`) used to run tests as part of the `--command=` parameter. **This is required**. `xargs` must be present as well.
  ** `--verbose` is an optional parameter for `circleci tests run` which enables more verbose debugging messages.
  ** `--split-by-timings` enables intelligent test splitting by timing for `circleci tests run`. Note that this is not required in order to use `circleci tests run`. If your testing job is not using CircleCI's test splitting, omit this parameter.
  
[#verify-the-configuration]
==== Verify the configuration

After updating your configuration, click the "Re-run failed tests only" button the next time you encounter a test failure on that job.

If the `--verbose` setting is enabled, you should see output similar to the following the next time you run this job on CircleCI:

```sh
Installing circleci-tests-plugin-cli plugin.
circleci-tests-plugin-cli plugin Installed. Version: 1.0.3349-470dac4
DEBU[2023-04-10T22:36:53Z] Attempting to read from stdin. This will hang if no input is provided. 
INFO[2023-04-10T22:36:53Z] starting batch execution                      batch_count=1 batches_processed=0 total_batches_for_job=3
DEBU[2023-04-10T22:36:53Z] received test names: test_api.py
```

The job should only re-run tests that are from a `classname` of `filename` that had at least one test failure when the "Re-run failed tests only" button is clicked. If you are seeing different behavior, comment on this https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Discuss post] for support.

[#additional-examples]
== Additional examples

[#configure-a-job-running-ruby-rspec-tests]
=== Configure a job running Ruby (rspec) tests

. Add the following gem to your Gemfile:
+
```bash
gem 'rspec_junit_formatter'
```

. Modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml
 - run: mkdir ~/rspec
 - run:
    command: |
      circleci tests glob spec/**/*_spec.rb | circleci tests run --command="xargs bundle exec rspec --format progress --format RspecJunitFormatter -o ~/rspec/rspec.xml" --verbose
```

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case. See the RSpec section in the xref:collect-test-data#rspec[Collect Test Data] document for details on how to output test results in an acceptable format for `rspec`.

[#configure-a-job-running-ruby-cucumber-tests]
=== Configure a job running Ruby (Cucumber) tests

. Modify your test command to look something similar to:
+
```yaml
- run: mkdir -p ~/cucumber
- run:
    command: |
    circleci tests glob features/**/*.feature | circleci tests run --command="xargs bundle exec cucumber --format junit --out ~/cucumber/junit.xml" --verbose
```

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case. See the Cucumber section in the xref:collect-test-data#cucumber[Collect Test Data] document for details on how to output test results in an acceptable format for `Cucumber`.

[#configure-a-job-running-cypress-tests]
=== Configure a job running Cypress tests

. Install the `cypress-multi-reporters` and `mocha-junit-reporter` dependencies. If using `npm`, run the following on your local machine:
+
```bash
npm install --save-dev cypress-multi-reporters mocha-junit-reporter
```
+
Your `package.json` / `package-lock.json` will be updated and committed on your next push from that branch. 

. Create and set up the reporter config file, if it does not already exist. In this example, the file is named `reporter-config.json`.
+
```json
{
  "reporterEnabled": "spec, mocha-junit-reporter", // set the reporters
  "reporterOptions": {
    "mochaFile": "results/junit/junit-[hash].xml", // each suite produces its own junit, save them with unique hash
  }
}
```

. Modify your test command to use the two `--reporter` flags and `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml
     -run:
        name: run tests
        command: | 
          cd ./cypress 
          npm ci 
          npm run start &
          circleci tests glob "cypress/**/*.cy.js" | circleci tests run --command="xargs npx cypress run --reporter cypress-multi-reporters --reporter-options configFile=reporter-config.json --spec" --verbose
```
+
Remember to modify the `glob` command for your specific use case.

. Because Cypress does not output the expected `filename` attribute on its JUnit XML files, follow the steps outlined link:https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter/issues/132[in this issue] to massage the test results into the proper format. In this example, we have saved a copy of link:https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter/issues/132#issuecomment-721943600[this script] to a file named `fix-junit.js`. 
+
Invoke this script by adding a new `run` step in your `.circleci/config.yml` file in the same job where you are running your tests. The snippet below also includes the `store_test_results` step to upload test results:
+
```yaml
    - run:
       when: always
       name: process test results (add in file path in junit)
       command: |
          cd ./cypress
          node ./scripts/fix-junit.js
    - store_test_results: 
       path: ./cypress/results
```  

Your new testing job's `.circleci/config.yml` definition should have both snippets from steps 3 and 4 above, one right after the other.  

[#configure-a-job-running-javascript-typescript-jest-tests]
=== Configure a job running Javascript/Typescript (Jest) tests

. Install the `jest-junit` dependency. You can add this step in your `.circleci/config.yml`:
+
```yaml
  - run:
      name: Install JUnit coverage reporter
      command: yarn add --dev jest-junit
```
+
You can also add it to your `jest.config.js` file by following these link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-junit[usage instructions].  

. Modify your test command to look something similar to:
+
```yaml
- run:
    command: |
      npx jest --listTests | circleci tests run --command=“xargs npx jest --config jest.config.js --runInBand --”
    environment:
      JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR: ./reports/
      JEST_JUNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE: true
     
  - store_test_results:
      path: ./reports/
```

. Update the `npx jest --listTests` command to match your use case. See the Jest section in the xref:collect-test-data#jest[Collect Test Data] document for details on how to output test results in an acceptable format for `jest`.
+
`JEST_UNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE=true` is added to ensure that the `filename` attribute is present. `JEST_UNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE=true` can also be added to your `jest.config.js` file instead of including it in `.circleci/config.yml`, by using the following attribute: `addFileAttribute= "true"`.

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* When re-running only the failed tests, test splitting by timing may not be as efficient as expected the next time that job runs, as the test results being stored are only from the subset of failed tests that were run.
* Orbs that run tests may not work with this new functionality at this time.
* If a shell script is invoked to run tests, `circleci tests run` should be placed **in the shell script** itself, and not `.circleci/config.yml`.
* Jobs that are older than the xref:persist-data#custom-storage-usage[retention period] for workspaces for the organization cannot be re-run with "Re-run failed tests only".

[#FAQs]
== FAQs

**Question:** I have a question or issue, where do I go?

**Answer:** Leave a comment on the https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Discuss post].

---

**Question:** Will this functionality re-run individual tests?

**Answer:** No, it will re-run failed test `classnames` or `filenames` that had at least one individual test failure.

---

**Question:** What happens if I try to use the functionality and it hasn't been set-up in my `.circleci/config.yml` file?

**Answer:** The job will fail.

---

**Question:** When can I click the option to "Re-run failed tests only?"

**Answer:** Currently, it will be present any time the "Re-run workflow from failed" option is present, and vice versa.

---

**Question:** I don't see my test framework on this page, can I still use the functionality?

**Answer:** Yes, as long as your job meets the xref:#prerequisites[prerequisites] outlined above. The re-run failed tests only functionality is test runner- and test framework-agnostic. You can use the methods described in the xref:collect-test-data#[Collect test data] document to ensure that the job is uploading test results. Note that `classname` and `filename` is not always present by default, so your job may require additional configuration.  

From there, follow the xref:#quickstart[Quickstart] section to modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`. 

If you run into issues, comment on the https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Discuss post].

**Question:** Can I see in the web UI whether a job was re-run using "Re-run failed tests only"?

**Answer:** Not at this time.
