NOTE: The config policies feature is available on the **Scale** plan and from CircleCI server v4.2.

Follow the how-to guides on this page to manage, create, and use config policies.

[#config-policy-management-enablement]
== Enable or disable policy evaluation for an organization

Control whether policy evaluation is applied to pipeline configurations within your organization using the `--enabled` flag.

* To **enable** policy evaluation run the following command. This sets `--enabled` to `true`, which means project configurations **will** be evaluated against your organization's policies when pipelines are triggered.:
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci policy settings --enabled=true --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,shell]
----
{
  "enabled": true
}
----

* To **disable** policy evaluation run the following command. This sets `--enabled` to `false`, which means project configurations **will not** be evaluated against your organization's policies when pipelines are triggered.:
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci policy settings --enabled=false --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,shell]
----
{
  "enabled": false
}
----

[#manage-policies-with-your-vcs]
== Manage policies with your VCS

CircleCI policies are managed by pushing directories of policies to CircleCI via the CLI. There are various ways to manage your policies but here is a list of recommended best practices:

* Store your policies in a repository in your VCS, within your organization. This is how policies are managed internally at CircleCI. Pushing a policy bundle is done by triggering a CircleCI pipeline.

* Create a bot account for pushing policies, and use its associated CircleCI personal API token for authentication. For maximum security the token should be stored as an environment variable within a context, and that context should be restricted to groups that are responsible for managing policies. For more information, see the link:/docs/contexts[Using Contexts] page.

The rest on the steps in this section show how to set up a CI/CD pipeline to manage your policies.

[#prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

For the config policies pipeline recommended in this guide you will need to securely manage some environment variables:

* `CIRCLECI_CLI_TOKEN` with the value of a personal API token to authenticate the CLI
* `ORG_ID` with the value of the organization ID

You can do this using a context. For more information about setting up and using contexts to securely manage environment variables see the xref:contexts#[Using contexts] page. You might already have a context set up for this or you might want to create a new one. For this example the context name `my-context` is used.

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Organization settings > Contexts**
. Click **Create Context** and enter a name for your context, for example `my-context`
. Click your new context name in the list to access options
. Click **Add Environment Variable** and enter `CIRCLECI_CLI_TOKEN` for the environment variable name, and your personal API token string for the value (For more information about this see the xref:local-cli#configuring-the-cli[Installting the CircleCI local CLI] page). Then click **Add Environment Variable** again to complete.
. Click **Add Environment Variable** and enter `ORG_ID` for the environment variable name, and your organization ID for the value.

[set-up-a-config-policy-management-ci-pipeline]
=== Set up a config policies CI/CD pipeline

. Set up a repository in your VCS to manage policies. In this example the repo is called `config-policies`.

. Make a local clone of your repo using your preferred method.

. Create a directory in your new repo for your Rego policy files, for example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file for your new policies repository, and copy and paste the config example below. This configuration pushes policies to CircleCI on commits to the `main` branch, and shows a diff of the policy bundle on commits to all other branches:
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  circleci-cli: circleci/circleci-cli@0.1.9 # Use orb to make the `circleci-cli/default` executor available for running jobs

workflows:
  main-workflow:
    jobs:
      - diff-policy-bundle:
          context: my-context
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: main # on all branches other than main
      - push-policy-bundle:
          context: my-context
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main # only on the main branch

jobs:
  diff-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Diff policy bundle
          command: circleci policy diff ./config --owner-id $ORG_ID # show a diff of the policy bundle

  push-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Push policy bundle
          command: circleci policy push ./config --no-prompt --owner-id $ORG_ID # push the policy bundle to CircleCI
----
+
Your file structure should now look something like:
+
[source,shell]
----
.
├── README.md
├── .circleci
    └── config.yml
└── config-policies
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The context for each job is shown as `my-context`. This context name is arbitrary, but it must be active and declare the following environment variables:

* `CIRCLECI_CLI_TOKEN` with the value of a personal API token to authenticate the CLI
* `ORG_ID` with the value of the organization ID

For setup steps see the <<prerequisites>> on this page.
====

[#create-a-policy]
== Create a policy

Once you have decided how to manage your policies, the next step is to create a policy. Follow the steps in this section to create a policy that checks the `version` of CircleCI config files to ensure `version` is greater than or equal to `2.1`.

[#write-your-policy]
=== 1. Write your policy

CAUTION: Ensure you have authenticated your version of the CLI with a token, and updated the CLI, before attempting to use the CLI with config policies. See the link:/docs/local-cli[Installing the Local CLI] page for more information.

. <<config-policy-management-enablement,Enable config policies>> for your organization, if you have not already done so.

. If you have followed the steps above to set up CI/CD for your config policies, you will already have a directly for storing your policies. If not, create an empty directory to store your policies. For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Inside your new directory create a Rego file for your new policy. Call it, `version.rego`.

. Add the following content to `version.rego`:
+
[source,rego]
----
# All policies start with the org package definition
package org

policy_name["example"]

# signal to circleci that check_version is enabled and must be included when making a decision
# Also, signal to circleci that check_version is a hard_failure condition and that builds should be
# stopped if this rule is not satisfied.
enable_hard["check_version"]

# define check version
check_version = reason {
    not input.version # check the case where version is not in the input
    reason := "version must be defined"
} {
    not is_number(input.version) # check that version is number
    reason := "version must be a number"
} {
    not input.version >= 2.1 # check that version is at least 2.1
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.1 but got %v", [input.version])
}
----

[#push-up-your-policy-bundle]
=== 2. Push up your policy bundle

You can now push your new policy to your organization for it to take effect. You have two options:

* Push the policy manually using the CLI from your local environment
* Push your changes to your config policy repo if you are managing policies via your VCS as shown <<manage-policies-with-your-vcs,above>>.

[tab.allow.manual]
--
Create and upload the policy bundle using CircleCI CLI:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy push ./config-policies –-owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

If the upload was successful, you will see something like the following:

[source,shell]
----
{
  “Created”: [“example”]
}
----
--

[tab.allow.push_to_vcs]
--
If you have set up your config policies repository with the sample configuration shown <<manage-policies-with-your-vcs,above>>, push your changes to the `main` branch of your config policies repository, and head to the CircleCI web app to see your policy pipeline run.

You can also push to a development branch, in which case you will get a diff of your policy bundle when you push your changes, rather than your new policy being pushed to your CircleCI organization. This is useful when developing your policies.
--

Now, when a pipeline is triggered within your organization, the project's `.circleci/config.yml` will be validated against this policy.

[#update-a-policy]
=== 3. Update your policy

To illustrate making a change to an existing policy, suppose you made an error when creating the policy above. You realize that some project configurations in your organization are using CircleCI config version `2.0`, and you want your policy to reflect this.

. Change the last check of your rule definition in your `version.rego` file to:
+
[source,rego]
----
{
    not input.version >= 2.0 # check that version is at least 2.0
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.0 but got %v", [input.version])
}
----

. Push the policy directory containing the updated policy:
+
[tab.change.manual]
--
Create and upload the policy bundle using CircleCI CLI:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy push ./config-policies –-owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

If the upload was successful, you will see something like the following:

[source,shell]
----
{
  “Created”: [“example”]
}
----
--
+
[tab.change.push_to_vcs]
--
Push your changes to the `main` branch of your config policies repository, and head to the CircleCI web app to see your policy pipeline run.

You can also push to a development branch, in which case you will get a diff of your policy bundle when you push your changes, rather than your new policy being pushed to your CircleCI organization. This is useful when developing your policies.
