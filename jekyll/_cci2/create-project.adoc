[#step-one-link-your-vcs-with-circleci]
== Step One: Link your VCS with CircleCI

If you have not done so already, <<first-steps#,sign up with CircleCI>> and select your Version Control System (VCS). You can also sign up with email.

A CircleCI project must be linked with an existing repo in your VCS. Make sure you have a repo and that you have authorized CircleCI to access it (in GitHub, you have the option to block CircleCI from accessing your private repositories).

[#step-two-create-a-project-in-circleci]
== Step Two: Create a project in CircleCI

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

. In CircleCI, click **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project and click the blue **Set Up Project** button next to it.

If you cannot see your project, check you have selected the correct organization in the top left-hand corner of CircleCI.

[#step-three-specify-a-config-file]
== Step Three: Specify a config file

Once you have set up your project, you will be prompted to provide a `config.yml` file.

. From the pop-up window, select your preferred option. You can either:
+
* Include a `config.yml` in the `.circleci` directory of your repo.
* Commit a starter CI pipeline to a new branch of your repo.
* Use an editable `config.yml` template.
+
If you choose the starter CI pipeline, a sample `config.yml` file is created and committed to a `circleci-project-setup` branch in your repo.
+
For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see <<config-intro#,Configuration Introduction>>.
+
. Click the blue **Set Up Project** button.

CircleCI then uses the specified `config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, either edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo, or click the ellipsis next your project in the Dashboard and choose **Configuration File**.

This opens the CircleCI Configuration Editor, from where you can edit and commit your `config.yml` file.
