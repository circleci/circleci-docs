This guide gets you started with creating a new project in CircleCI.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A code repository you want to build on CircleCI.

== Build a new project on CircleCI

The authorization method used to set up your CircleCI account determines the definition of "project" in CircleCI, as well as the permissions management processes available to you:

* If you authenticated using xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app], or xref:bitbucket-integration#[Bitbucket], a "project" in CircleCI maps directly to a "repository" in GitHub. Follow steps to <<set-up-a-project>> below.
* If you authenticated through xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab] or the CircleCI xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App], a "project" within CircleCI is a standalone entity that you create and then associate with a code repository. Follow steps to <<create-a-project>> below.

[#set-up-a-project]
=== Set up a project

NOTE: If you authenticated CircleCI with either the xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app], or xref:bitbucket-integration#[Bitbucket], the steps in this section apply to you.

Follow these steps to  set up a new project in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, click **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list and click the blue **Set Up Project** button next to it.

+
If you cannot see your project, check you have selected the correct organization in the top left-hand corner of CircleCI.
+

+
Once you have set up your project, you will be prompted to provide a `config.yml` file.

. From the pop-up window, select your preferred option. You can either:
+
* Include a `config.yml` in the `.circleci` directory of your repository.
* Commit a starter CI pipeline to a new branch of your repository.
* Use an editable `config.yml` template.
+
If you choose the starter CI pipeline, a sample `config.yml` file is created and committed to a `circleci-project-setup` branch in your repository.
+
For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see <<config-intro#,Configuration Introduction>>.
+
. Click the blue **Set Up Project** button.

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, either edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository, or click the ellipsis next your project in the Dashboard and choose **Configuration File**. This opens the CircleCI configuration editor, from where you can edit and commit your `config.yml` file.

[#create-a-project]
=== Create a project

If you authorized CircleCI with either xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab], or the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App], follow the steps in the section below that applies to you.

[#github-app-project]
==== GitHub App project

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, click **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Click btn:[Create Project] at the top of the page.
+

. In the Connect Code window, click the **GitHub** tile.
. In the Create New Project window, use the options to:
+
** Input your project name in the Project Name field.
** Follow the instructions to set up SSH access.
** Tell CircleCI where your code is stored.
** Click btn:[Create Project] at the bottom of the window. CircleCI will now automatically generate a custom configuration file based on the programming languages and frameworks detected in your selected repository.
** When the custom configuration file has been generated, click btn:[Commit and Run] to commit your custom configuration file on a new branch called `circleci-project-setup`. Alternatively, click btn:[Review configuration file] to view the custom configuration file in the configuration editor.
** If CircleCI is unable to generate a custom configuration file, CircleCI will generate a fallback template that you can utilize to create your `config.yml` file.

[#gitlab-project]
==== GitLab project

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, click **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Click btn:[Create Project] at the top of the page.
+
image::create-project-button.png[Create a project]

. In the Connect Code window, click the **GitLab** tile.
. In the Create New Project window, use the options to:
+
** Tell CircleCI where your code is stored
** Choose an option for managing your `.circleci/config.yml` file. You can either choose to let CircleCI pick a configuration file for you, and commit this to a new branch in you repository, or you can edit a starter config file in the CircleCI web app and commit that to your repository yourself.
** For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see the following pages:
*** xref:config-intro#[Configuration introduction]
*** xref:sample-config#[Sample config.yml files]
*** xref:configuration-reference#[Configuration reference]
+

. The Project Name field is automatically populated with the name of your repository, but you can change this if required.

. Click **Create Project** at the bottom of the window.

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository.
