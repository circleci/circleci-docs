This guide gets you started with creating a new project in CircleCI.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* Code you want to build on CircleCI.

== Build a new project on CircleCI

The authorization method used to set up your CircleCI account determines the definition of "project" in CircleCI, as well as the permissions management processes available to you:

On the **Organization Home** page, check which option you see:

* If you see a btn:[Set up a project] button, follow steps to <<set-up-a-project>> below.
* If you see a btn:[Create Project] button, follow steps to <<create-a-project>> below.

NOTE: Using CircleCI server? Use the <<set-up-a-project>> steps below. Rather than Organization Home you will see Dashboard in the web app sidebar.

[#create-a-project]
=== Create a project

NOTE: If you have integrated your code with the xref:github-apps-integration#[CircleCI GitHub App], xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab], or xref:bitbucket-data-center-integration#[Bitbucket Data Center], the steps in this section apply to you.

Choose steps to follow below, depending on where your code is stored:

[.tab.create-project.GitHub_App]

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

include::../_includes/partials/create-project/steps-up-to-pipeline.adoc[Insert steps from selecting Create project up to setting up a pipeline]

. Choose a repo to connect to your project.
+
If you do not see your repo listed, select btn:[Add] to access repositories from GitHub. Select btn:[GitHub] and then btn:[Authorize in GitHub]
+
NOTE: **First GitHub project?** If this is the first GitHub project you are creating, you will be redirected to GitHub and asked to install and authorise the CircleCI GitHub App. At this point you can choose to connect CircleCI to all your repositories, or select a subset of repositories to connect. This is a one-time action that can be done by an organization administrator or someone who has admin access to a repository in your org.
+
.Choose a repo to connect your code to your project
image::create-project/choose-a-repo-github.png[Choose a repository window with option to add another VCS]

. In this next step CircleCI will prepare a config file for you, unless your repo already contains a CircleCI config file. In a later step you will commit this config to your repo on a new branch. If you do already have a CircleCI config file in your repo it will be displayed. Once you have your config, select btn:[Next: set up your triggers].
+
.Set up your CircleCI config file
image::create-project/set-up-your-config.png[Screenshot showing options to set up your config file]

. Set up triggers for your pipeline. A single GitHub App trigger is set up by default to build your project on every commit to your repo. You can xref:pipelines#triggers[add more triggers] at this point too.
+
.Set up triggers for your pipeline
image::create-project/set-up-your-triggers.png[Screenshot showing options to set up your triggers]

. Next you can review everything you have just set up, then select btn:[Commit config and run], or btn:[Finish setup] if you already have a config file in your repo.
+
.Review and finish setup

NOTE: **First GitLab project?** If you are creating the first GitLab project for your org, you will be redirected to GitLab to authorise the integration. This is a one-time action that can be done by an organization administrator or someone who has admin access to a repository in your org.

. In the Create New Project window, ensure you have the right repo selected in the dropdown. If you have a CircleCI config file already available in your repo, CircleCI will detect it. If not you can select an option for adding one:
+
.Set up a new GitLab project
image::create-project/create-new-gitlab-project.png[Create new project window]
+
** **Fastest:** Use a config file that already exists in your repository.
** **Faster:** Let CircleCI pick a configuration file for you, and commit this to a new branch in you repository.
** **Fast:** View and edit a starter config file in the CircleCI web app and commit that to your repository yourself.

. Select **Create Project** at the bottom of the window.

. If you chose the fastest/faster options you will now be on the pipelines page of the CircleCI web app. If you chose "fast" you have some options:

** Select btn:[Commit and Run] to commit your custom configuration file on a new branch called `circleci-project-setup`.
+
.Use a generated config file

. In the Create New Project window, you have some options:
+
.Set up your new GitLab self-managed project
image::create-project/create-new-gitlab-self-managed-project.png[Create new project window]
+
[NOTE]
====
If this is your first GitLab self-managed project you will now set up your integration:

* Verify your GitLab URL
* Generate an add a personal access token
* Add your known hosts, following the instructions in the app
====

** Use the repository dropdown menu to tell CircleCI where your code is stored.
** Select **Create Project**. You will then be redirected to the Pipelines page.
** The express CircleCI configuration setup is not currently available for GitLab self-managed projects. You will need to add a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository if it has not yet been set up. If the repository you selected already contains a `.circleci/config.yml`, push a commit to see your pipeline on the dashboard.

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output on the pipelines page. To make changes to your pipeline, edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository.

Through creating a project and connecting your code you have set up your pipeline and a trigger. The default trigger runs your pipeline when a change is committed to your code. You can create more triggers at menu:Project settings[Triggers]. For more information, see the xref:pipelines#triggers[Pipelines overview].

[#set-up-a-project]
=== Set up a project

NOTE: If you authenticated CircleCI with either the xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app] or xref:bitbucket-integration#[Bitbucket Cloud], or if you use CircleCI server, the steps in this section apply to you.

Follow these steps to  set up a new project in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Organization Home** in the sidebar. The equivalent option in CircleCI server is **Dashboard**
. Select btn:[Set up a project].
+
.Set up a project
image::create-project/set-up-a-project.png[Set up a project button]
. Find your project in the list and select btn:[Set Up Project].
+
[TIP]
====
**Can't see your project?** Select the CircleCI logo at the top of the window to navigate to your user homepage and select an organization.

.Access your user homepage
image::create-project/user-home-page.png[Select Organization]
====

. Choose a `config.yml` option in the modal. You can choose from the following:
** **Fastest**: Use a CircleCI `.circleci/config.yml` you have already committed to your repository. For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see the <<config-intro#,Configuration Introduction>>. You will also need to specify a branch.
** **Faster**: Commit a starter CI pipeline to a new `circleci-project-setup` branch of your repository.
** **Fast**: View, edit, and commit a template `config.yml`.

. Select **Set Up Project**.

CircleCI uses the specified `.circleci/config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, choose one of the following:

* Edit the config file in your repository,
* Select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]) next your project in the Pipelines or Projects dashboard and choose **Configuration File**. This opens the CircleCI configuration editor, from where you can edit and commit your `config.yml` file.
* Access the configuration editor using the btn:[Edit Config] button from a the Pipelines page when you have a project and branch selected.
