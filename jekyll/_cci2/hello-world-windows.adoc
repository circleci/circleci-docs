= Hello world on Windows
:description: First Windows project on CircleCI
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs

This document describes how to get started with continuous integration on *Windows execution environments* on CircleCI. If this is your first time setting up CircleCI, we recommend checking out the xref:getting-started#[Getting Started guide].

A Windows Server 2022 image is available to CircleCI cloud customers, read more on link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/march-2022-support-for-new-operating-system-for-windows-executors-windows-server-2022/43198[Discuss].

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To follow along with this document you will need:

* An link:https://circleci.com/signup/[account] on CircleCI.
* Either the Free, Performance, or Scale link:https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/[Plan].

[#example-application]
== Example application

Let us consider a more advanced (but still introductory) "hello world" application using the Windows executor. This link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-windows[example application] still prints "Hello World" to the console, but does so using .NET core to create an executable, uses dependency caching, and creates an artifact on every build.

You can view the entire configuration link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-windows/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml[here]. It also includes browser and UI testing, but we will focus on the `hello-world` workflow for now.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
----

Above, we start by declaring that we will use version `2.1` of CircleCI, giving us access to link:https://circleci.com/orbs/[orbs] and xref:pipelines#[Pipelines].

[,yaml]
----
orbs:
  win: circleci/windows@4.1.1
----

Next, we declare orbs that we will be using in our build. We will only use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/windows[Windows orb] to help us get started. This example uses the 2.4.0 version of the orb, but you may consider using a more recent version.

[,yaml]
----
workflows:
  hello-world:
    jobs:
      - build
----

We define a `hello-world` workflow, in which we run a single job named `build`.

[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    executor:
      name: win/default
----

Under the `jobs` key, we define the `build` job, and set the executor via the orb we are using.

[,yaml]
----
    steps:
      - checkout
----

In our first step, we run the xref:configuration-reference#checkout[`checkout`] command to pull our source code from our version control system.

[,yaml]
----
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
      - run:
          name: "Install project dependencies"
          command: dotnet.exe restore
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - C:\Users\circleci\.nuget\packages
----

Next in the config, we make use of caching to restore cached dependencies from previous builds. The command `dotnet restore` will fetch any dependencies that are not already installed/restored from the cache. Learn more about caching in our xref:caching#[caching document].

[,yaml]
----
      - run:
          name: "Run Build step"
          command: dotnet.exe publish -c Release -r win10-x64
      - run:
          name: "Test the executable"
          command: .\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.1\win10-x64\publish\circleci-demo-windows.exe
----

Next, we run two steps: one to build the executable for Windows 10, and another to test the executable (expecting to see `Hello World` printed to the console).

[,yaml]
----
      - store_artifacts:
          path: .\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.1\win10-x64\publish\circleci-demo-windows.exe
----

In our last step, we store the build executable as an artifact, making it accessible with the CircleCI web application or API.

[#next-steps]
== Next steps

Consider reading documentation on some of CircleCI's features:

* See the xref:concepts#[Concepts] document for a summary of configuration and the hierarchy of top-level keys in a `.circleci/config.yml` file.
* Refer to the xref:workflows#[Workflows] document for examples of orchestrating job runs with concurrent, sequential, scheduled, and manual approval workflows.
* Find complete reference information for all keys and pre-built Docker images in the xref:configuration-reference#[Configuring CircleCI] and xref:circleci-images#[CircleCI Images] documentation, respectively.
