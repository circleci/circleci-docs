= Use the CircleCI CLI for config and policy development - Open preview

NOTE: The config policies feature is available on the **Scale** plan and is currently in **open preview**.

CAUTION: While the config policies feature is in **open preview**, a service failure will result in build configurations **not** being evaluated against policies. This should be taken into consideration before using config policies for compliance purposes.

CAUTION: Ensure you have authenticated your version of the CLI with a token, and updated the CLI, before attempting to use the CLI with config policies. See the link:/docs/local-cli[Installing the Local CLI] page for more information.

[#develop-configs]
== Develop configs

Policies for CircleCI configs detect violations and stop builds that do not comply with your organization's policies. However, this raises an issue for local development of `.circleci/config.yml` files. Modifications to your `config.yml` can cause your pipeline to be blocked. This slows down development time and can be frustrating.

To mitigate this, you can run your `config.yml` against your organization's policies locally, outside of your CI pipelines, using the CircleCI CLI. You can get immediate feedback on config compliance.

The following command requests the specified config input be judged against the organization's policies. The command returns a CircleCI _decision_ containing the status, and any violations that may have occurred.

Example decision command:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy decide --owner-id $ORG_ID --input $PATH_TO_CONFIG
----

Example CircleCI decision:

[source,json]
----
{
    "status": "HARD_FAIL",
    "hard_failures": [
        {
            "rule": "custom_rule",
            "reason": "custom failure message"
        }
    ],
    "soft_failures": [
        {
            "rule": "other_rule",
            "reason": "other failure message"
        }
    ]
}

[#develop-policies]
== Develop policies

The CLI provides a language-agnostic way of evaluating local policies against arbitrary config inputs. This is the recommended
way of developing and testing policies. It is similar to the previous command except that it provides a path to the local policies directory.

The policy files (*.rego) present in the given policy directory (searched recursively) will form the policy bundle.

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy decide --input $PATH_TO_CONFIG $PATH_TO_POLICY_DIR
----

Policies that use `data.meta...` values like `vcs.branch` or `project_id` should also provide a JSON file mocking those values with `--metafile $PATH_TO_JSON`

It is recommended that you build a test suite of policy/config combinations and run them locally, or in CI, before pushing them to your organization's active policies.

[#get-policy-decision-audit-logs]
== Get policy decision audit logs

Audit logs provide documentary evidence for a policy decision being performed at a certain point of time.
Audit logs include the inputs which influenced the decision, as well as the outcome of the decision.

The CLI provides a `policy logs` command to fetch the policy decision logs for your organization.

Following is the output of this command when run with `--help` flag:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy logs --help

# Returns the following:
Get policy (decision) logs


Usage:
  circleci policy logs [flags]

Examples:
policy logs  --owner-id 462d67f8-b232-4da4-a7de-0c86dd667d3f --after 2022/03/14 --out output.json

Flags:
      --after string        filter decision logs triggered AFTER this datetime
      --before string       filter decision logs triggered BEFORE this datetime
      --branch string       filter decision logs based on branch name
      --context string      policy context (default "config")
  -h, --help                help for logs
      --out string          specify output file name
      --owner-id string     the id of the policy's owner
      --project-id string   filter decision logs based on project-id
      --status string       filter decision logs based on their status

[#input]
=== Input
* The organization ID information is required, which can be provided with `--owner-id` flag.
* The command accepts the following filters for logs: `--after`, `--before`, `--branch`, `--status`, and `--project-id`. These filters are optional. Also, any combination of filters can be used to suit your auditing needs.

[#output]
=== Output
* Stdout: By default, the decision logs are printed as a list of logs to the standard output.
* File: Output can be written to a file (instead of stdout). This can be done by providing the file path using `--out` flag.
