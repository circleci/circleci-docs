CircleCI Server's VM service controls how https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-machin[`machine`] executor
(Linux and Windows images) and https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images[Remote Docker] jobs are run.

This section describes the available configuration options for VM Service.

toc::[]

NOTE: We recommend that you leave these options at their defaults until you have successfully configured and verified your server installation.

== AWS EC2
You will need the following fields to configure your VM Service to work with AWS EC2. Note that the Access Key and Secret
Key used by VM Service differs from the policy used by object storage in the previous section.

. *AWS Region* (required): This is the region the application is in.
. *AWS Windows AMI ID* (optional): If you require Windows builders, you can supply an AMI ID for them here.
. *Subnet ID* (required): Choose a subnet (public or private) where the VMs should be deployed.
. *Security Group ID* (required): This is the security group that will be attached to the VMs.

The recommended security group configuration can be found in the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-install-hardening-your-cluster[Hardening Your Cluster] section.

[start=5]
. *AWS IAM Access Key ID* (required): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[AWS Access Key ID] for EC2 access.
. *AWS IAM Secret Key* (required): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[IAM Secret Key] for EC2 access.

It is recommended to create a new user with programmatic access for this purpose. You should attach the following IAM policy to the user:

== Google Cloud Platform
You will need the following fields to configure your VM Service to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

. *GCP project ID* (required): Name of the GCP project the cluster resides.
. *GCP Zone* (required): GCP zone the virtual machines instances should be created in IE `us-east1-b`.
. *GCP Windows Image* (optional): Name of the image used for Windows builds. Leave this field blank if you do not require them.
. *GCP VPC Network* (required): Name of the VPC Network.
. *GCP VPC Subnet* (optional): Name of the VPC Subnet. If using auto-subnetting, leave this field blank.
. *GCP Service Account JSON file* (required): Copy and paste the contents of your https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[service account JSON file].

WARNING: We recommend you create a unique service account used exclusively by VM Service. The Compute Instance Admin (Beta)
role is broad enough to allow VM Service to operate. If you wish to make permissions more granular, you can use the
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#compute.instanceAdmin[Compute Instance Admin (beta) role] documentation as reference.

== Configuring VM Service

. *Number of <VM type> VMs to keep prescaled*: By default, this field is set to 0 which will create and provision instances
of a resource type on demand. You have the option of preallocating up to 5 instances per resource type. Preallocating
instances lowers the start time allowing for faster machine and `remote_docker` builds. Note, that preallocated instances
are always running and could potentially increase costs. Decreasing this number may also take up to 24 hours for changes
to take effect. You have the option of terminating those instances manually, if required.
. *VM Service Custom Configuration*: Custom configuration can fine tune many aspects of your VM service. This is an advanced
option and we recommend you reach out to your account manager to learn more.
