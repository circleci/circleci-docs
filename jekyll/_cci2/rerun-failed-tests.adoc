:page-description: How to rerun only failed tests in a job and optimize credit usage.
:icons: font
:experimental:


Use the rerun failed tests feature to only rerun a subset of tests instead of rerunning the entire test suite when a transient test failure arises.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

When you select **rerun failed tests** (see image below), a new workflow is triggered where only a subset of tests are rerun, instead of rerunning the entire test suite when a transient test failure arises.

Historically, when a testing job in a workflow had flaky tests, the only option to get to a successful workflow was to link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050303671-How-To-Rerun-a-Workflow[rerun your workflow from failed]. This type of rerun executes *all tests* from your testing job, including tests that passed, which prolongs time-to-feedback and consumes credits unnecessarily.

This rerun failed tests option reruns failed tests from the _same_ commit, not from subsequent commits.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Your testing job in the workflow is configured to xref:collect-test-data/#[upload test results] to CircleCI. `file` or `classname` attributes **must be present** in the xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#junit-xml-reports[JUnit XML output].
* The testing job uses `circleci tests run` (see below for details) to execute tests.
+
NOTE: If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[intelligent test splitting], you must *change* the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` combined with a `--split-by=` flag  (see below for instructions).

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

[#example-config-file-before]
=== Before: example `.circleci/config.yml` file

```yaml
 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py" | circleci tests split --split-by=timings)
      pytest -o junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml $TEST_FILES

- store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

This example snippet is from a CircleCI configuration file that:

. Executes Python test files that end in `.py`,
. Splits tests by previous timing results (you can follow xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[this tutorial] on intelligent test splitting),
. Stores the test results in a new directory called `test-results`, and
. Uploads those test results to CircleCI.

NOTE: `-o junit_family=legacy` is present to ensure that the test results being generated contain the `file` attribute. Not included in this snippet is the config key to set parallelism (read the xref:parallelism-faster-jobs#[Test splitting and parallelism] page for more information).

[#example-config-file-after]
=== After: example `.circleci/config.yml` file

In the snippet below, the example has been updated to use the `circleci tests run` command to allow for rerunning only failed tests.

```yaml
 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py")
      echo "$TEST_FILES" | circleci tests run --command="xargs pytest -o junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml" --verbose --split-by=timings #--split-by=timings optional, only use if you are using CircleCI's test splitting

 - store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

* `TEST_FILES=$(circleci tests glob "**/test_*.py")`
+
Use CircleCI's xref:troubleshoot-test-splitting#video-troubleshooting-globbing[glob command] to put together a list of test files. In this case, we are looking for any test file that starts with `test_` and ends with `.py`. Ensure that the glob string is enclosed in quotes.

* `echo "$TEST_FILES" |`
+
Pass the list of test files to the `circleci tests run` command as standard input (link:https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/stdin.htm[`stdin`]).

* `circleci tests run --command="xargs pytest -o junit_family=legacy --junitxml=test-results/junit.xml" --verbose --split-by=timings`
** Invoke `circleci tests run` and specify the original command (`pytest`) used to run tests as part of the `--command=` parameter. **This is required**. `xargs` must be present as well.
** `--verbose` is an optional parameter for `circleci tests run` which enables more verbose debugging messages.
** *Optional*: `--split-by=timings` enables intelligent test splitting by timing for `circleci tests run`. Note that this is not required in order to use `circleci tests run`. If your testing job is not using CircleCI's test splitting, omit this parameter.  For `pytest`, `--timings-type=name` is the most straightforward to integrate with the way that `pytest` outputs its JUnit XML out-of-the-box.

NOTE: You can specify the timing type similar to `circleci tests split --split-by=timings --timings-type=` using a `--timings-type=` flag.  You can pass `file`, `classname`, or `name` (`name` splits by test name) to `--timings-type=` as a flag to `circleci tests run`.

[#verify-the-configuration]
==== Verify the configuration

After updating your configuration, run the job that runs tests again and make sure that the same number of tests are being executed as before the config.yml change.

Then, the next time you encounter a test failure on that job, click the "Rerun failed tests" button.  If the `--verbose` setting is enabled, you should see output similar to the following the next time you click btn:[Rerun failed tests] with this job on CircleCI:

```sh
Installing circleci-tests-plugin-cli plugin.

INFO[2023-05-18T22:09:08Z] starting execution
DEBUG[2023-05-18T22:09:08Z] Received: ****
```

If you see `rerunning failed tests` present in the step's output, the functionality is configured properly.  You'll also see output that shows the total number of failed tests from the original job run, the total number of

The job should only rerun tests that are from a `classname` of `file` that had at least one test failure when the btn:[Rerun failed tests] button is clicked.

    circleci tests glob "features/**/*.feature" | circleci tests run --command="xargs bundle exec cucumber --format junit,fileattribute=true --out ~/cucumber/junit.xml" --verbose --split-by=timings

- store_test_results:
    ~/cucumber
```
. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case. See the Cucumber section in the xref:collect-test-data#cucumber[Collect Test Data] document for details on how to output test results in an acceptable format for `Cucumber`. **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.** If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.

[#configure-a-job-running-cypress-tests]
=== Configure a job running Cypress tests

. Use the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-circleci-reporter[`cypress-circleci-reporter` package] (note this is a 3rd party tool that is not maintained by CircleCI).  You can install in your `.circleci/config.yml` or add to your `package.json`. Example for adding to `.circleci/config.yml`:
+
```yaml
  #add required reporters (or add to package.json)
  -run:
    name: Install coverage reporter
    command: |
      npm install --save-dev cypress-circleci-reporter
```

. Use the `cypress-circleci-reporter`, `circleci tests run`, and upload test results to CircleCI:
+
```yaml
     -run:
        name: run tests
        command: |
          mkdir test_results
          cd ./cypress
          npm ci
          npm run start &
          circleci tests glob "cypress/**/*.cy.js" | circleci tests run --command="xargs npx cypress run --reporter cypress-circleci-reporter --spec" --verbose --split-by=timings #--split-by=timings is optional, only use if you are using CircleCI's test splitting

     - store_test_results:
        path: test_results
```
+

. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Update the `glob` command to match your specific use case.  **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.** If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.

Cypress may output a warning saying `Warning: It looks like you're passing --spec a space-separated list of arguments:`.  This can be ignored, but it can be removed by following the guidance from our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only-circleci-tests-run/47775/18[community forum].

[#configure-a-job-running-javascript-typescript-jest-tests]
=== Configure a job running JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest) tests

      npx jest --listTests | circleci tests run --command="JEST_JUNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE=true xargs npx jest --config jest.config.js --runInBand --" --verbose --split-by=timings
    environment:
      JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR: ./reports/
- store_test_results:
    path: ./reports/
```

. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Update the `npx jest --listTests` command to match your use case. See the Jest section in the xref:collect-test-data#jest[Collect Test Data] document for details on how to output test results in an acceptable format for `jest`. **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.** If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.
+
`JEST_JUNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE=true` is added to ensure that the `file` attribute is present. `JEST_JUNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE=true` can also be added to your `jest.config.js` file instead of including it in `.circleci/config.yml`, by using the following attribute: `addFileAttribute="true"`.

[#configure-a-job-running-playwright-tests]
=== Configure a job running Playwright tests

. Modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml

      pnpm run serve &
      TESTFILES=$(circleci tests glob "specs/e2e/**/*.spec.ts")
      echo "$TESTFILES" | circleci tests run --command="xargs pnpm playwright test --config=playwright.config.ci.ts --reporter=junit" --verbose --split-by=timings

 - store_test_results:
    path: results.xml
```

. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case. **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.**. If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted. Note: you may also use link:https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#junit-reporter[Playwright's built-in flag] (`PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME`) to specify the JUnit XML output directory.
+
NOTE: Ensure that you are using version 1.34.2 or later of Playwright. Earlier versions of Playwright may not output JUnit XML in a format that is compatible with this feature.

[#configure-a-job-running-kotlin-or-gradle-tests]
=== Configure a job running Kotlin or Gradle tests

. Modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml

    # Get list of classnames of tests that should run on this node.
    circleci tests glob "**/*.java" | cut -c 1- | sed 's@/@.@g' | sed 's/.\{5\}$//' | circleci tests run --command=">classnames.txt xargs echo" --verbose --split-by=timings --timings-type=classname

    #if this is a re-run and it is a parallel run that does not have tests to run, halt execution of this parallel run
    [ -s classnames.txt ] || circleci-agent step halt
```
+
```yaml

    GRADLE_ARGS=$(cat src/test/java/classnames.txt | awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) print "--tests",$i}')
    echo "Prepared arguments for Gradle: $GRADLE_ARGS"

    ./gradlew test $GRADLE_ARGS

- store_test_results:
    path: build/test-results/test
```

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case. **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.**. If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.


[#configure-a-job-running-go-tests]
=== Configure a job running Go tests

. Modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml
- run:
    command: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --" --split-by=timings --timings-type=name

- store_test_results:
    path: junit.xml
```
. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. **If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.**. If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.

[#configure-a-job-running-elixir-tests]
=== Configure a job running Elixir tests

. Modify your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml
- run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      circleci tests glob 'lib/**/*_test.exs'
      | circleci tests run --command='xargs -n1 echo > test_file_paths.txt'

      mix ecto.setup --quiet
      cat test_file_paths.txt | xargs mix test

- store_test_results:
    path: _build/test/my_app/test-junit-report.xml
    when: always
```
. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Update the `glob` command to match your use case.

[#configure-a-job-running-phpunit-tests]
=== Configure a job running PHPUnit tests

. Edit your test command to use `circleci tests run`:
+
```yaml

# Use phpunit-finder to output list of tests to stdout for a test suite named functional
# Pass those tests as stdin to circleci tests run

- run:
    name: Run functional tests
    command: |
      TESTS_TO_RUN=$(/data/vendor/bin/phpunit-finder -- functional)
      echo "$TESTS_TO_RUN" | circleci tests run --command="xargs -I{} -d\" \" /data/vendor/bin/phpunit {} --log-junit /data/artifacts/phpunit/phpunit-functional-$(basename {}).xml" --verbose --split-by=timings

- store_test_results:
    path: artifacts/phpunit
    when: always
```

. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

. Note that this example uses a utility named link:https://github.com/previousnext/phpunit-finder[`phpunit-finder`] which is a third party tool that is not supported by CircleCI, use at your own risk. If your current job is using xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[CircleCI's intelligent test splitting], you must change the `circleci tests split` command to `circleci tests run` with the `--split-by=timings` parameter.**. If you are not using test splitting, `--split-by=timings` can be omitted.

[#output-test-files-only]
=== Output test files only

If your testing set-up on CircleCI is not compatible with invoking your test runner in the `circleci tests run` command, you can opt to use `circleci tests run` to receive the file names, output the file names, and save the file names to a temporary location.  You can then subsequently invoke your test runner using the outputted file names.

Example:

```yaml
 - run:
    command: |
      circleci tests glob "src/**/*js" | circleci tests run --command=">files.txt xargs echo" --verbose --split-by=timings #split-by=timings is optional
      [ -s tmp/files.txt ] || circleci-agent step halt #if a re-run and there are no tests to re-run for this parallel run, stop execution

 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      ... #pass files.txt into your test command

 - store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

The snippet above will write the list of test file names to `files.txt`.  On a non-rerun, this list will be all of the test file names.  On a "rerun", the list will be a subset of file names (the test file names that had at least 1 test failure in the previous run).  You can pass the list of test file names from `files.txt` into, for example, your custom `makefile`.  If using parallelism, CircleCI spins up the same number of containers/VMs as the parallelism level that is set in `.circleci/config.yml`. However, not all parallel containers/VMs will execute tests.  For the parallel containers/VMs that will not run tests, `files.txt` may not be created.  The `halt` command ensures that in the case where a parallel run is not executing tests, the parallel run is stopped.

[#configure-a-job-running-django-tests]
=== Configure a job running Django tests

Django takes as input test filenames with a format that uses dots ("."), however, it outputs JUnit XML in a format that uses slashes "/".  To account for this, get the list of test filenames first, change the filenames to be separated by dots "." instead of slashes "/", and pass the filenames into the test command.

```
- run:
    name: get tests
    command: |
      # Get the test file names, write them to files.txt, and split them by historical timing data
      circleci tests glob "**/test*.py" | circleci tests run --command=">files.txt xargs echo" --verbose --split-by=timings #split-by-timings is optional
      [ -s files.txt ] || circleci-agent step halt #if a re-run and there are no tests to re-run for this parallel run, stop execution

- run:
    name: Run tests
    command:
      # Change filepaths into format Django accepts (replace slashes with dots).  Save the filenames in a TESTFILES variable
      cat files.txt | tr "/" "." | sed "s/\.py//g" | sed "s/tests\.//g" > circleci_test_files.txt
      cat circleci_test_files.txt
      TESTFILES=$(cat circleci_test_files.txt)
      # Run the tests (TESTFILES) with the reformatted test file names
      pipenv run coverage run manage.py test --parallel=8 --verbosity=2 $TESTFILES

- store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```

. Ensure you are using `xargs` in your `circleci tests run` command to pass the list of test files/classnames via stdin to `--command`.

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* If your testing job uses parallelism and test splitting, the job will spin up the number of containers/virtual machines (VMs) that are specified with the `parallelism` key. However, the step that runs tests for each of those parallel containers/VMs will only run a subset of tests, or no tests, after the tests are split across the total number of parallel containers/VMs.
+
For example, if parallelism is set to eight, there may only be enough tests after the test splitting occurs to "fill" the first parallel container/VM. The remaining seven containers/VMs will still start up, but they will not run any tests when they get to the test execution step.
+
**In most cases, you can still observe substantial time and credit savings** despite spinning up containers/VMs that do not run tests.
+
If you would like to maximize credit savings, you can check for whether the parallel container/VM will execute tests as the first step in a job, and if there are no tests to run, terminate job execution.  With this approach, ensure that the logic to run tests happens in a subsequent step. For example:
+
```yml
steps:
  - checkout
  - run: |
    mkdir -p ./tmp && \
    >./tmp/tests.txt && \
    circleci tests glob "spec/**/*_spec.rb" | circleci tests run --command=">./tmp/tests.txt xargs echo" --split-by=timings #Get the list of tests for this container/VM

    [ -s tmp/tests.txt ] || circleci-agent step halt #if there are no tests, terminate execution after this step

 - run:
    name: Run tests
    command: |
      mkdir test-results
      ...

 - store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```


+
See <<parallel-rerun-failure>> for a workaround to avoid failures if you are also using `persist_to_workspace`.
+
NOTE: The `halt` command will execute the rest of the _current_ step, regardless of whether `tests.txt` has content or not. Make sure to place the command to execute tests in the _following_ step.

* Orbs that run tests may not work with this new functionality at this time.
* If a shell script is invoked to run tests, `circleci tests run` should be placed **in the shell script** itself, and not `.circleci/config.yml`. Alternatively, see the <<output-test-files-only,section above>> to pipe the list of test files to be run to a `.txt` file and then pass the list of test file names to your shell script.
* Jobs that are older than the xref:persist-data#custom-storage-usage[retention period] for workspaces for the organization cannot be rerun with "Rerun failed tests".
* Jobs that upload code coverage reports:

To ensure that code coverage reports from the original job run are persisted to an artifact in addition to the report that is generated on a re-run, see the following example for a sample Go project:

The snippet above uses the built-in xref:caching#[`.Revision`] key to store a coverage report for the current VCS revision.  On a successful rerun, the original job run's coverage report will be restored to include the coverage from the skipped (passed) tests. It can then be used in a downstream job for aggregation or analysis.
+
A similar method can be used to ensure that the job following a re-run uses timing for test splitting from both the original job run & the re-run.  Instead of storing and restoring `cover.out` in the cache, store and restore the test results XML.  If a similar method is not used, the job following a re-run may be slightly less efficient if using test splitting by timing.

* Rerun failed tests is not currently supported for the Windows execution environment.

* If your job runs two different types of tests in the same job, the feature may not work as expected.  In this scenario, it is recommended that the job is split into two jobs, each running a different set of tests with `circleci tests run`.


[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

[#all-tests-rerun]
=== All tests are still being rerun

After configuring `circleci tests run`, if you see *all tests* are rerun after clicking btn:[Rerun failed tests], check the following:

. Ensure that the `--verbose` setting is enabled when invoking `circleci tests run`. This will display which tests `circleci tests run` is receiving on a "rerun".

. Use xref:configuration-reference#storeartifacts[`store_artifacts`] to upload the JUnit XML that contains test results to CircleCI.  This is the same file(s) that is being uploaded to CircleCI with `store_test_results`.

. Manually inspect the newly uploaded JUnit XML via the **Artifacts** tab and ensure that there is a `file=` attribute or a `classname` attribute.  If neither are present, you will see unexpected behavior when trying to rerun.  Follow the instructions on this page to ensure that the test runner you are using is outputting its JUnit XML test results with a `file` (preferred) or `classname` attribute.  Comment in our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only-circleci-tests-run/47775/48[community forum] if you are still stuck.

. Ensure that `xargs` is present in the `--command=` argument.

[#no-test-names]
=== No test names found in input source

If you are seeing the following message: `WARN[TIMESTAMP] No test names found in input source. If you were expecting test names, please check your input source.`

Ensure that you are passing a list of test filenames (or classnames) *via stdin* to `circleci tests run`.  The most common approach to do this is to use a glob command: `circleci tests glob "glob pattern" | circleci tests run --command="xargs test command" --verbose`

[#test-filenames-include-sapces]
=== Test file names include spaces

`circleci tests run` expects input to be space or newline delimited.  If your test file names have spaces in them, this may pose a problem. For example, if you are using `pytest` which may generate names with whitespace.  One possible workaround is to use specific IDs for the tests with whitespace in their names using the instructions from the link:https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/parametrize.html#set-marks-or-test-id-for-individual-parametrized-test[official `pytest` documentation].

[#parallel-rerun-failure]
=== Parallel rerun failure

If your job runs tests in parallel and persists files to a workspace, you may see a parallel run on a rerun that fails because the `persist_to_workspace` step could not find any contents in the directory that was specified. This may happen because the parallel run will not always execute tests on a rerun if there are not enough tests to be distributed across all parallel runs.

To avoid such a failure, add a `mkdir` command before you run any tests to set up the directory (or directories) that will be persisted to a workspace.

```yaml
steps:
      - checkout
      - run: mkdir no_files_here
      - run: #test command with circleci tests run that populates no_files_here if tests are run
      - store_test_results:
          path: ./test-results
      - store_artifacts:
          path: ./test-results
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: .
          paths:
            - no_files_here
```

On a rerun, if the parallel run is running tests, `no_files_here` will be populated. If it is not running any tests, the `persist_to_workspace` step will not fail because the `no_files_here` directory exists.

[#approval-jobs]
=== Approval jobs

If your workflow has an approval job, and a failed job containing failed tests that you wish to rerun, you will not be able to click btn:[Rerun failed tests] until the workflow has terminated.  This means that you must cancel the approval job before you can click btn:[Rerun failed tests].

[#Error-can-not-rerun-failed-tests-no-failed-tests-could-be-found]
=== Error: can not rerun failed tests: no failed tests could be found

If your job that has failed uploads test results but there are no failed tests and `circleci tests run` was used, the "rerun failed tests" button will be clickable.  However, upon clicking, the new workflow will fail with the following message: `Error: can not rerun failed tests: no failed tests could be found`.

To resolve this error, use "Rerun workflow from failed" to rerun all tests.  "Rerun failed tests" will only work if there are failed tests reported in the "Tests" tab.

[#FAQs]
== FAQs


**Question:** I have a question or issue, where do I go?

**Answer:** Leave a comment on the https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Discuss post].

---

**Question:** Will this functionality rerun individual tests?

**Answer:** No, it will rerun failed test `classnames` or test filenames (`file`) that had at least one individual test failure.

---

**Question:** When can I use the option to btn:[Rerun failed tests]?

**Answer:** The job must be uploading test results to CircleCI and using `circleci tests run`.

---

**Question:** I don't see my test framework on this page, can I still use the functionality?

**Answer:** Yes, as long as your job meets the xref:#prerequisites[prerequisites] outlined above. The rerun failed tests functionality is test runner and test framework-agnostic. You can use the methods described in the xref:collect-test-data#[Collect test data] document to ensure that the job is uploading test results. Note that `classname` and `file` is not always present by default, so your job may require additional configuration.

From there, follow the xref:#quickstart[Quickstart] section to edit your test command to use `circleci tests run`.

If you run into issues, comment on the https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-re-run-failed-tests-only/47775/[Discuss post].

---

**Question:** Can I see in the web UI whether a job was rerun using "Rerun failed tests"?

**Answer:** Not currently.

---

**Question:** My maven surefire tests are failing when I try to set this feature up?

**Answer:** You may need to add the `-DfailIfNoTests=false` flag to ensure the testing framework ignores skipped tests instead of reporting a failure when it sees a skipped test on a dependent module.

---

**Question:** Can I specify timing type for test splitting using `circleci tests run`?

**Answer:** Yes, you can specify the timing type as when using `circleci tests split --split-by=timings --timings-type=` using a `--timings-type=` flag.  You can pass `file`, `classname`, or `name` (`name` splits by test name) as a flag to `circleci tests run`.

---

**Question:** Are tests that my test runner reported as "Skipped" or "Ignored" rerun when I click btn:[Rerun failed tests]?

**Answer:** No, only test files/classnames that have at least one test case reported as "Failed" will be rerun.

---

**Question:** I use Cypress and my job seems to be uploading test results just fine, but the failed test re-run is still running all of the tests instead of just the failed tests

**Answer:** It is possible that the JUnit XML files do not have the proper metadata for the failed tests rerun.  Try using the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-circleci-reporter[`cypress-circleci-reporter` package] to ensure the test results being uploaded have the proper JUnit XML format.

---

**Question:** What is the oldest job that can use "rerun failed tests"?

**Answer:** Rerunning failed tests is currently available for workflows that are less than 15 days old.

---

**Question:** Can I use the `--record` functionality with Cypress and "rerun failed tests"?

**Answer:** Yes, you can pass the `--group` flag to Cypress and the `--ci-build-id` flag to group the results of CircleCI's parallelization.  Because the name passed to `--group` must be unique within the run, you can use CircleCI's built-in environment variables:

[,shell]
----
circleci tests glob ".cypress/**/*.spec.js" | circleci tests run --command="xargs npx cypress run --record --group "$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM-$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX" --ci-build-id $CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM --reporter cypress-circleci-reporter --spec" --verbose --split-by=timings
