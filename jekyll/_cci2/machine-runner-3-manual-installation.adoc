This page describes how to manually start CircleCI's machine runner 3.0 on macOS and Linux.

CAUTION: We recommend installing and using CircleCI machine runner 3.0 with xref:install-machine-runner-3-on-macos.adoc[the Homebrew package] on macOS and xref:install-machine-runner-3-on-linux.adoc[the Linux packages] on Linux. The manual method described on this page is an optional alternative.

WARNING: If you follow this manual installation method, CircleCI machine runner 3.0 will not automatically update.

== 2. Download the CircleCI machine runner

NOTE: The current CircleCI machine runner binary can always be found by using `current` as the version. To install a specific previous version of the CircleCI runner the `$RUNNER_VERSION` environment variable can be changed from the value of `current` to the specific preferred version.

[,shell]
----
export RUNNERVERSION='current'
export CPUARCH=$(/usr/bin/arch | grep 'x86_64' && echo 'amd64' || echo 'arm64')
export OSTARGET=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
curl -s -L "https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-runner/${RUNNERVERSION}/circleci-runner_${OSTARGET}_${CPUARCH}.tar.gz" -o $HOME/circleci-runner.tar.gz && tar -zxvf $HOME/circleci-runner.tar.gz
----

[#mark-machine-runner-as-executable]
== 3. Mark the CircleCI machine runner as executable

Update permissions for your CircleCI machine runner to enable running its binary:

[,shell]
----
chomd +x $HOME/circleci-runner
----

[#create-configuration-and-working-directory]
== 4. Create the CircleCI machine runner configuration and working directory

. Create the directory in which CircleCI machine runner jobs will start:
+
[,shell]
----
mkdir $HOME/circleci
----

. Create a CircleCI runner configuration file:
+
[,shell]
----
touch $HOME/circleci-runner-config.yaml
----

. Populate the newly created file with the configuration for your runner. An example can be seen below.
+
NOTE: You will need to change the `auth_token` value from `"your-auth-token"` to the resource class token created in step 1.
+
[,shell]
----
nano $HOME/circleci-runner-config.yaml
----
+
[,shell]
----
runner:
  name: "my-macos-runner"
  working_directory: "$HOME/circleci"
  cleanup_working_directory: true
api:
  auth_token: "your-auth-token"
----
