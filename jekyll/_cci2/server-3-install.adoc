// This doc uses ifdef and ifndef directives to display or hide content specific to Google Cloud Storage (env-gcp) and AWS (env-aws). Currently, this affects only the generated PDFs. To ensure compatability with the Jekyll version, the directives test for logical opposites. For example, if the attribute is NOT env-aws, display this content. For more information, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/.

Before you begin with the CircleCI server v3.x core services installation phase, ensure all xref:server-3-install-prerequisites.adoc[prerequisites] are met.

NOTE: In the following sections replace any items or credentials displayed between `< >` with your details.

== Phase 2: Core services installation
CircleCI server v3.x uses https://kots.io[KOTS] from https://www.replicated.com/[Replicated] to manage and distribute server v3.x. KOTS is a `kubectl` https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/[plugin].
To install the latest version, you can run `curl \https://kots.io/install | bash`.

Ensure you are running the minimum KOTS version ({kotsversion}) by running the command:

```bash
kubectl kots version
```

NOTE: The KOTS command will open up a tunnel to the admin console. If running on Windows inside WSL2, the port is not available on the host machine. Turning WSL off and back on should resolve the issue. For more information, please see
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4199.

From the terminal run (if you are installing behind a proxy see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-install/#installing-behind-an-http-proxy[Installing behind HTTP Proxy]):

```bash
kubectl kots install circleci-server
```

You will be prompted for a:

* namespace for the deployment
* password for the KOTS admin console

When complete, you should be provided with a URL to access the KOTS admin console, usually `\http://localhost:8800`.

NOTE: If you need to get back to the KOTS admin console at a later date you can run: `kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>`

NOTE: Once you have created your namespace, we recommend setting your `kubectl` context too with the following command: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace <namespace>`

=== Installing behind an HTTP Proxy

If you wish to install CircleCI server behind a proxy, the following command structure should be used (for more information see the KOTS docs https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#proxies[here]):

```bash
kubectl kots install circleci-server --http-proxy <YOUR_HTTP_PROXY_URI> --https-proxy <https-proxy> --no-proxy <YOUR_NO_PROXY_LIST>
```

The load balancer endpoints must be added to the no-proxy list for the following services: `output processor` and `vm-service`. This is because the no-proxy list is shared between the application and build-agent. The application and build-agent are assumed to be behind the same firewall and therefore cannot have a proxy between them.

For further information see the https://circleci.com//docs/2.0/server-3-operator-proxy/index.html[Configuring a Proxy] guide.

=== Frontend Settings
Frontend settings control the web application specific aspects of the CircleCI system.

.Frontend Settings
image::server-3-frontend-settings.png[Screenshot showing frontend settings]

Complete the fields described below. You can either supply a private key and certificate, or check the box that allows Let's Encrypt or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html[AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)] to automatically request and manage certificates for you. You can also disable TLS termination at this point, but the system will still need to be accessed over HTTPS.

==== Using ACM TLS Certificates

If you would like to use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html[AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)] to manage your TLS certificates, you can follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html[ACM documentation] for instructions on how to generate ACM certificates.

Once you have generated your certificates, you can enable ACM from the KOTS admin console under the Frontend section. Check the ACM box and provide your ACM ARN (Amazon Resource Name), as shown in the example below.

.ACM Settings
image::server-3-frontend-settings.png[Screenshot showing frontend settings]

[WARNING]
==== 
If you have already deployed CircleCI server, enabling ACM is a destructive change to your frontend service. The service will have to be regenerated to allow the use of your ACM certificates and so the associated loadbalancer will also be regenerated. 
You will need to reroute your DNS records to the new loadbalancer once you have redeployed CircleCI server.
====

NOTE: If you are selecting the option to use private load balancers, the Let's Encrypt option will no longer work and become unavailable.

* *Domain Name (required)* - Enter the domain name you specified when creating your Frontend TLS key and certificate.

* *Frontend Replicas (optional)* - Used to increase the amount of traffic that can be handled by the frontend.

* *Frontend TLS Private Key (required)* - You created this during your pre-requisite steps. You can retrieve this value with the following command:
+
```bash
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem
```

* *Frontend TLS Certificate (required)* - You created this during your prerequisite steps. You can retrieve this value with the following command:
+
```bash
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem
```

* *Private Load Balancer (optional)* - Load balancer does not generate external IP addresses.

==== Artifact and Encryption Signing Settings
Encryption and artifact signing keys were created during prerequisites phase. You can enter them here now.

Complete the following fields:

* *Artifact Signing Key (required)*

* *Encryption Signing Key (required)*

==== Github Settings
You created your Github OAuth application in the prerequisite phase. Use the data to complete the following:

* *Github Type (required)* -
Select Cloud or Enterprise (on premises).

* *OAuth Client ID (required)* -
The OAuth Client ID provided by Github.

* *OAuth Client Secret (required)* -
The OAuth Client Secret provided by Github.

* *Github Enterprise Fingerprint* -
Required when using a proxy. Include the output of `ssh-keyscan github.example.com` in the text field.

==== Object Storage Settings

You created your Object Storage Bucket and Keys in the prerequisite steps. Use the data to complete the following:

// Don't include this section in the GCP PDF.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

===== S3 Compatible
You should have created your S3 Compatible bucket and optional IAM account during the prerequisite steps.

* *Storage Bucket Name (required)* -
The bucket used for server.

* *AWS S3 Region (optional)* -
AWS region of bucket if your provider is AWS. S3 Endpoint is ignored if this option is set.

* *S3 Endpoint (optional)* -
API endpoint of S3 storage provider. Required if your provider is not AWS. AWS S3 Region is ignored if this option is set.

* *Storage Object Expiry (required)* -
Number of days to retain your test results and artifacts. Set to 0 to disable and retain objects indefinitely.

====== Authentication
One of the following is required. Either select IAM keys and provide:

* *Access Key ID (required)* -
Access Key ID for S3 bucket access.

* *Secret Key (required)* -
Secret Key for S3 bucket access.

Or select IAM role and provide:

* *Role ARN* -
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[Role ARN for Service Accounts] (Amazon Resource Name) for S3 bucket access.

// Stop hiding from GCP PDF:

endif::env-gcp[]

// Don't include this section in the AWS PDF:

ifndef::env-aws[]

===== Google Cloud Storage
You should have created your Google Cloud Storage bucket and service account during the prerequisite steps.

* *Storage Bucket Name (required)* -
The bucket used for server.

* *Storage Object Expiry (required)* -
Number of days to retain your test results and artifacts. Set to 0 to disable and retain objects indefinitely.

====== Authentication

* *Service Account JSON (required)* -
A JSON format key of the Service Account to use for bucket access.

endif::env-aws[]

// Stop hiding from AWS PDF

==== Postgres, MongoDB, Vault settings

You can skip these sections unless you plan on using an existing Postgres, MongoDB or Vault instance, in which case see the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-operator-externalizing-services/[Externalizing Services doc]. By default, CirecleCI server will create its own Postgres, MongoDB and Vault instances within the CircleCI namespace. The instances inside the CircleCI namespace will be included in the CircleCI backup and restore process.

=== Save and deploy
Once you have completed the fields detailed above, it is time to deploy. The deployment will install the core services and provide you with an IP address for the Traefik load balancer. That IP address will be critical in setting up a DNS record and completing the first phase of the installation.

NOTE: In this first stage we skipped a lot of fields in the config. We will revisit those in the next stages of installation.

=== Create DNS entry
Create a DNS entry for your Traefik load balancer, for example, `circleci.your.domain.com` and `app.circleci.your.domain.com`. The DNS entry should align with the DNS names used when creating your TLS certificate and GitHub OAuth app during the prerequisites steps. All traffic will be routed through this DNS record.

You will need the IP address or, if using AWS, the DNS name of the Traefik load balancer. You can find this with the following command:

----
kubectl get service circleci-server-traefik --namespace=<YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

For more information on adding a new DNS record, see the following documentation:

* link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/records#adding_a_record[Managing Records] (GCP)

* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html[Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 Console] (AWS)

NOTE: The Traefik load balancer has a healthcheck that serves a JSON payload at https://loadbalancer-address/status.

=== Validation

You should now be able to navigate to your CircleCI server installation and log in to the application successfully. Now we will move on to build services. It may take a while for all your services to be up. You can periodically check by running the following command (you are looking for the “frontend” pod to show a status of _running_ and **ready** should show 1/1):

----
kubectl get pods -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
