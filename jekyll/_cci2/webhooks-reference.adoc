[#common-top-level-keys]
== Common top level keys of webhooks

Each webhook will have some common data as part of the event:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field
| Description
| Type

| id
| ID used to uniquely identify each event from the system (the client can use this to dedupe events)
| String

| happened_at
| ISO 8601 timestamp representing when the event happened
| String

| webhook
| A map of metadata representing the webhook that was triggered
| Map
|===

NOTE: The event payloads are open maps, meaning new fields may be added to maps in the webhook payload without considering it a breaking change.

[#common-sub-entities]
== Common sub-entities of webhooks

The following sections describe the payloads of different events offered with CircleCI webhooks. The schema of these webhook events will often share data with other webhooks. These common maps of data are referred to as "sub-entities". For example, when you receive an event payload for the `job-completed` webhook, it will contain maps of data for your *project, organization, job, workflow and pipeline*.

Some common sub-entities that will appear across various webhooks are described in the following sections:

[#project]
=== Project

The following data about the project associated with the webhook event is provided:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field
| Always present?
| Description

| id
| yes
| Unique ID of the project

| slug
| yes
| String that can be used to refer to a specific project in many of CircleCI's APIs (for example, `gh/circleci/web-ui`)

| name
| yes
| Name of the project (for example, `web-ui`)
|===

[#organization]
=== Organization

The following data about the organization associated with the webhook event is provided:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field
| Always present?
| Description

| id
| yes
| Unique ID of the organization

| name
| yes
| Name of the organization (e.g. "circleci")

=== Job

A link:/docs/jobs-steps/[job] typically represents one phase in a CircleCI workload (for example, "build", "test", or "deploy") and contains a series of steps.

The following data about the job associated with the webhook event is provided:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field
| Always present?
| Description

| id
| yes
| Unique ID of the job

| number
| yes
| An auto-incrementing number for the job, sometimes used in CircleCI's APIs to identify jobs within a project

| name
| yes
| Name of the job as defined in .circleci/config.yml

| status
| yes
| Current status of the job

| started_at
| yes
| When the job started running

| stopped_at
| no
| When the job reached a terminal state (if applicable)                                                        |
|===

[#workflow]
=== Workflow

link:/docs/workflows[Workflows] orchestrate jobs. The following data about the workflow associated with the webhook event is provided:

[.table.table-striped]

| url
| Yes
| URL to the workflow in CircleCI's UI
|===

[#pipeline]
=== Pipeline

Pipelines are the most high-level unit of work, and contain zero or more workflows. A single git-push always triggers up to one pipeline. Pipelines can also be triggered manually through the API.

The following Data about the pipeline associated with the webhook event is provided:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Field
