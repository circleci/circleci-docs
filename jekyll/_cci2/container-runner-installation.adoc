== 2. Container runner installation

. Add the container runner Helm repo by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
helm repo add container-agent https://packagecloud.io/circleci/container-agent/helm
----

. Next, run the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
helm repo update
----

. Then, run the following command to create the `circleci` Kubernetes namespace:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create namespace circleci
----

. Create a file called `values.yaml` file containing the following:
+
```yaml
agent:
  resourceClasses:
    namespace/my-rc:
      token: <resource_class_token>
```

. Finally, run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
helm install container-agent container-agent/container-agent -n circleci -f values.yaml
----

[#container-runner-configuration-example]
== Container runner configuration example

Once you have installed the container runner within your cluster, create and trigger a CircleCI job that uses the Docker executor to validate the installation. The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your container runners are:

* `image:`
* `resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>`

Simple example of how you could set up a job (`cimg/base:2021.11` is a commonly used CircleCI Docker image):

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.11
    resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build
```

CAUTION: **Do not** use an existing job that uses <<building-docker-images#,setup_remote_docker>> (see <<container-runner#building-container-images,Building container images>> for more information).
