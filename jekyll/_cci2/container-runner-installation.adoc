This page describes how to install CircleCI's container runner.

{% include snippets/runner-platform-prerequisites.adoc %}

[#installation-instructions]
== Installation instructions

. Add the container runner Helm repo by running `helm repo add container-agent https://packagecloud.io/circleci/container-agent/helm`

. Run `helm repo update`

. Run `kubectl create namespace circleci` to create the `circleci` Kubernetes namespace

. Create a file called `values.yaml` file containing the following:
+
```yaml
agent:
  resourceClasses:
    namespace/my-rc:
      token: <resource_class_token>
```

. Run `helm install container-agent container-agent/container-agent -n circleci -f values.yaml`

[#container-runner-configuration-example]
== Container runner configuration example

Once you have installed the container runner within your cluster, create and trigger a CircleCI job that uses the Docker executor to validate the installation. The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your self-hosted runners are:

* `image:`
* `resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>`

Simple example of how you could set up a job (`cimg/base:2021.11` is a commonly used CirlceCI Docker image):

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.11
    resource_class: <namespace>/<resource-class>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build
```

CAUTION: **Do not** use an existing job that uses <<building-docker-images#,setup_remote_docker>> (see <<container-runner#building-container-images,Building container images>> for more information).

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

Refer to the <<troubleshoot-self-hosted-runner#troubleshoot-container-runner,Troubleshoot Container Runner section>> of the Troubleshoot Self-hosted Runner guide if you encounter issues installing or running container runner.
