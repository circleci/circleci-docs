:experimental:

:page-liquid:

Enable CircleCI jobs to go through a set of well-defined IP address ranges. This can be useful if you are interacting with systems that are _not_ public, for example:

* Accessing a private artifact repository
* Testing internal systems
* Interfacing with a system on a cloud service: Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, etc.

[#overview]
== Introduction

IP ranges is a feature for CircleCI customers who need to configure IP-based access to their restricted environments using existing workflows and platforms. As part of this feature, CircleCI provides a list of well-defined IP address ranges associated with the CircleCI service. CircleCI jobs that have this feature enabled will have their traffic routed through one of the defined IP address ranges during job execution.

The feature is available to customers on a link:https://circleci.com/pricing/[Performance or Scale Plan]. This feature consumes 450 credits from your account for each GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

[#use-cases]
== IP ranges use cases

IP ranges let you limit inbound connections to your infrastructure to IP address ranges that are verifiably associated with CircleCI.

Some example of where IP-based restricted access might be desired include:

* Accessing private artifact repositories
* Pulling dependencies from a CocoaPods proxy hosted behind a firewall
* Running test cases on an internal environment
* Performing integration testing against private AWS resources
* Deploying an internal app with sensitive data
* Granting access to a production network

[#list-of-ip-address-ranges]
== List of IP address ranges associated with feature

_Last updated_: 2022-04-06

Jobs that have been opted into the IP ranges feature will have one of the following IP address ranges associated with them:

* 3.228.39.90
* 18.213.67.41
* 34.194.94.201
* 34.194.144.202
* 34.197.6.234
* 35.169.17.173
* 35.174.253.146
* 52.3.128.216
* 52.4.195.249
* 52.5.58.121
* 52.21.153.129
* 52.72.72.233
* 54.92.235.88
* 54.161.182.76
* 54.164.161.41

* 54.205.138.102
* 54.208.72.234
* 54.209.115.53

NOTE: Jobs can use any of the address ranges above. It is also important to note that the address ranges are shared by all CircleCI customers who have opted into using the feature.

[#list-of-ip-address-ranges-for-core-services]
== List of IP address ranges for core services

These are the IP address ranges for core services (used to trigger jobs, exchange information about users between CircleCI and GitHub etc):

* 18.214.70.5
* 52.20.166.242
* 18.214.156.84
* 54.236.156.101
* 52.22.215.219
* 52.206.105.184
* 52.6.77.249
* 34.197.216.176
* 35.174.249.131
* 3.210.128.175

[#list-of-ip-address-ranges-changelog]
=== List of IP address ranges changelog

==== 2021-08-23

* Added new items to the list of IP address ranges for core services.

The machine-consumable lists have also been updated to reflect the new IP address ranges.

==== 2022-04-06

* Added and removed new IP addresses as part of enabling Docker pulls to go through the list of IP addresses.

The machine-consumable lists have also been updated to reflect the new IP address ranges.

*Machine-consumable lists can be found by querying the DNS A records below:*

* IP address ranges _for jobs_: `jobs.knownips.circleci.com`.
* IP address ranges _for core services_: `core.knownips.circleci.com`.
* _All IP address ranges_:  `all.knownips.circleci.com`.

To query these, you can use any DNS resolver. Here is an example using `dig` with the default resolver:

[,shell]
----
dig all.knownips.circleci.com A +short
----

Notifications of a change to this list will be sent out by email to all customers who have at least one job opted into the IP ranges feature. *30 days notice* will be given before changes are made to the existing set of IP address ranges. This page and the machine-consumable list will also be updated when there are upcoming changes. 

[#pricing]
== Pricing

Pricing is calculated based on the data usage of jobs opted into the IP ranges feature. It is possible to mix jobs with and without the IP ranges feature within the same workflow or pipeline. Data used to pull in the Docker image to the container before the job starts executing does _not incur usage costs_ for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

This feature consumes 450 credits from your account for each GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

IP ranges usage is visible in the *Plan Usage* section of the CircleCI app:

On the *Resources* tab within the *Job Details* UI page, you can view approximations of network transfer for any Docker job, even those without the IP ranges feature enabled. This approximation can be used to predict the cost of enabling the IP ranges feature on a job without having to turn the feature on. See more details on the CircleCI https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/[blog]. You can also view whether or not the job has IP ranges enabled by viewing the IP Ranges badge.

[#aws-and-gcp-ip-addresses]
== AWS and GCP IP Addresses

The machines that execute _all jobs_ on CircleCI's platform, not just jobs opted into IP ranges, are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and CircleCI's macOS Cloud (see below). An exhaustive list of IP addresses that CircleCI's traffic may come from on these cloud providers`' platforms can be found by looking up each cloud provider's IP address ranges. AWS & GCP offer endpoints to find this information.

* link:https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json[AWS]: CircleCI uses the _us-east-1_ and _us-east-2_ regions
* link:https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json[GCP]: CircleCI uses the _us-east1_ and _us-central1_ regions

CircleCI _does not recommend_ configuring an IP-based firewall based on the AWS or GCP IP addresses, as the vast majority are not CircleCI's machines. There is _no guarantee_ that the addresses in the AWS or GCP endpoints persist from day-to-day, as these addresses are reassigned continuously.

[#circleci-macos-cloud]
== CircleCI macOS cloud

In addition to AWS and GCP (see above), CircleCI's macOS cloud hosts jobs executed by machines. The following IP address ranges are used by CircleCI macOS Cloud:

* 100.27.248.128/25
* 100.29.139.128/25
* 38.39.184.0/24
* 38.39.185.0/24
* 38.39.183.0/24
* 38.23.38.0/24
* 38.23.39.0/24
* 38.23.40.0/24
* 38.23.41.0/24
* 38.23.42.0/24
* 38.23.43.0/24
* 198.206.135.0/24
* 207.254.116.0/24
* 207.254.118.0/24

*IP ranges* is the recommended method for configuring an IP-based firewall to allow traffic from CircleCI's platform.

macOS builds are automatically restricted within the IP ranges listed here. In other words, you do not have to explicitly set `circleci_ip_ranges: true` for macOS builds. 

*macOS IP ranges are not included in the machine-consumable lists maintained in DNS.* Refer to the list above for the most up-to-date macOS IPs.

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* Currently, the system does not have support for specifying IP ranges configuration syntax when using the link:{{site.baseurl}}/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration[pipeline parameters feature]. Find more details in this https://discuss.circleci.com/t/ip-ranges-open-preview/40864/6[Discuss post].
* IP ranges is currently available for the link:{{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#machine[Docker executor], not including `remote_docker`. Jobs that attempt to use the IP ranges feature with a link:{{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/#machine[Machine executor], or with `setup_remote_docker`, will fail with an error. See this https://discuss.circleci.com/t/fyi-jobs-that-use-the-ip-ranges-feature-and-remote-docker-will-begin-to-fast-fail-this-week/44639[Discuss post] for details.
