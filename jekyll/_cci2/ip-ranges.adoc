= Restrict your pipeline traffic to specific IP ranges
:page-description: Enable CircleCI jobs to go through a set of well-defined IP address ranges
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:

Enable CircleCI jobs to go through a set of well-defined IP address ranges. This can be useful if you are interacting with systems that are _not_ public, for example:

* Accessing a private artifact repository.
* Testing internal systems.
* Interfacing with a system on a cloud service: Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, etc.

[#overview]
== Introduction

IP ranges is a feature for CircleCI customers who need to configure IP-based access to their restricted environments using existing workflows and platforms. As part of this feature, CircleCI provides a list of well-defined IP address ranges associated with the CircleCI service. CircleCI jobs that have the IP ranges feature enabled will have their traffic routed through one of the defined IP address ranges during job execution.

IP ranges is available to customers on a link:https://circleci.com/pricing/[Performance or Scale Plan].

Use of the IP ranges feature consumes 450 credits from your account for each 1 GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

[#use-cases]
== IP ranges use cases

Enabling IP ranges for a job limits inbound connections to your infrastructure to IP address ranges that are verifiably associated with CircleCI.

Some examples of when IP-based restricted access might be desired include the following:

* Accessing private artifact repositories.
* Pulling dependencies from a CocoaPods proxy hosted behind a firewall.
* Running test cases on an internal environment.
* Performing integration testing against private AWS resources.
* Deploying an internal app with sensitive data.
* Granting access to a production network.

== Examples of enabling IP ranges for a job

[#example-configuration]
=== Example configuration file using IP ranges

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    circleci_ip_ranges: true # opts the job into the IP ranges feature
    docker:
      - image: cimg/ruby:3.2.2
    steps:
      - run: echo “Hello World”

[#example-configuration-pipeline-parameters]
=== Example configuration file using IP ranges with pipeline parameters.

Use conditional logic to control when IP ranges is enabled with pipeline parameters. You can set the pipeline parameter `ip_ranges` to `true` to enable IP ranges for the `build` job. For more information on triggering pipelines with pipeline parameters, see the xref:triggers-overview#[Trigger a pipeline] page.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

parameters:
  ip_ranges:
    type: boolean
    default: false

jobs:
  build:
    # opts the job into the IP ranges feature when the pipeline parameter pipeline.parameters.ip_ranges is true
    circleci_ip_ranges: << pipeline.parameters.ip_ranges >>
    docker:
      - image: cimg/ruby:3.2.2

[#list-of-ip-address-ranges]
== List of IP address ranges associated with the IP ranges feature

_Last updated_: 2022-04-06

Jobs that have been opted into the IP ranges feature will have one of the following IP address ranges associated with them:

* 3.228.39.90
* 18.213.67.41
* 34.194.94.201
* 34.194.144.202
* 34.197.6.234
* 35.169.17.173
* 35.174.253.146
* 52.3.128.216
* 52.4.195.249
* 52.5.58.121
* 52.21.153.129
* 52.72.72.233
* 54.92.235.88
* 54.161.182.76
* 54.164.161.41
* 54.166.105.113
* 54.167.72.230
* 54.172.26.132
* 54.205.138.102
* 54.208.72.234
* 54.209.115.53

NOTE: Jobs can use any of the address ranges above. It is also important to note that the address ranges are shared by all CircleCI customers who have opted into using the feature.

*Machine-consumable lists can be found by querying the DNS A records below:*

* IP address ranges _for jobs_: `jobs.knownips.circleci.com`.
* IP address ranges _for core services_: `core.knownips.circleci.com`.
* _All IP address ranges_:  `all.knownips.circleci.com`.

To query these, you can use any DNS resolver. Here is an example using `dig` with the default resolver:

[,shell]
----
dig all.knownips.circleci.com A +short
----

Notifications of a change to this list will be sent out by email to all customers who have at least one job opted into the IP ranges feature. *30 days notice* will be given before changes are made to the existing set of IP address ranges. This page and the machine-consumable list will also be updated when there are upcoming changes.

[#pricing]
== IP ranges feature pricing

Pricing is calculated based on the data usage of jobs opted into the IP ranges feature. It is possible to mix jobs with and without the IP ranges feature within the same workflow or pipeline. Data used to pull in the Docker image to the container before the job starts executing does _not incur usage costs_ for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

Enabling IP ranges consumes 450 credits from your account for each GB of data used for jobs with IP ranges enabled.

IP ranges usage is visible in the *Plan Usage* section of the CircleCI app:

image::ip-ranges.png[Screenshot showing the location of the IP ranges feature]

On the *Resources* tab within the *Job Details* UI page, you can view approximations of network transfer for any Docker job, even those without the IP ranges feature enabled. This approximation can be used to predict the cost of enabling the IP ranges feature on a job without having to turn the feature on. See more details on the CircleCI https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/[blog]. You can also view whether or not the job has IP ranges enabled by viewing the IP Ranges badge.

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* IP ranges is currently available for the xref:configuration-reference#machine[Docker executor], not including `remote_docker`. Jobs that attempt to use the IP ranges feature with a xref:configuration-reference#machine[Machine executor], or with `setup_remote_docker`, will fail with an error. See this link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/fyi-jobs-that-use-the-ip-ranges-feature-and-remote-docker-will-begin-to-fast-fail-this-week/44639[Discuss post] for details.

== IP ranges for core CircleCI services

This section covers the IP ranges used by CircleCI core services. Core service IP ranges are separate from the IP ranges _feature_ list, which is available <<list-of-ip-address-ranges,here>>.

[#list-of-ip-address-ranges-for-core-services]
=== List of IP address ranges for core CircleCI services

The following list shows the IP address ranges for core CircleCI cloud services (used to trigger jobs, exchange information about users between CircleCI and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket):

* 18.214.70.5
* 52.20.166.242
* 18.214.156.84
* 54.236.156.101
* 52.22.215.219
* 52.206.105.184
* 52.6.77.249
* 34.197.216.176
* 35.174.249.131
* 3.210.128.175

[#aws-and-gcp-ip-addresses]
=== AWS and GCP IP Addresses

The machines that execute all jobs on CircleCI's platform, not just jobs opted into IP ranges, are hosted on the following platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* CircleCI's macOS cloud

An exhaustive list of IP addresses that CircleCI's traffic may come can be found by looking up each cloud provider's IP address ranges. AWS and GCP offer endpoints to find this information:

* link:https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json[AWS]: CircleCI uses the _us-east-1_ and _us-east-2_ regions.
* link:https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json[GCP]: CircleCI uses the _us-east1_ and _us-central1_ regions.

CAUTION: CircleCI _does not recommend_ configuring an IP-based firewall using the AWS or GCP IP addresses. The vast majority are not CircleCI's machines. CircleCI can _not guarantee_ that the addresses in the AWS or GCP endpoints persist from day-to-day, as these addresses are reassigned continuously.

[#circleci-macos-cloud]
=== CircleCI macOS cloud

In addition to AWS and GCP (see above), CircleCI's macOS cloud hosts jobs executed by machines. The following IP address ranges are used by CircleCI macOS Cloud:

* 100.27.248.128/25
* 100.29.139.128/25
* 98.80.165.0/24
* 38.23.41.0/24
* 38.23.42.0/24
* 38.23.43.0/24
* 207.254.116.0/24
* 207.254.118.0/24
* 18.97.4.0/24
* 18.97.6.0/24
* 18.97.7.0/24

A link:https://circleci.com/docs/ip-ranges-list.json[machine-readable list of these IP ranges] is available as well

This list of IP Ranges can also be downloaded and saved using the following curl command:

[,shell]
----
curl -O https://circleci.com/docs/ip-ranges-list.json
----

*IP ranges* is the recommended method for configuring an IP-based firewall to allow traffic from CircleCI's platform.

macOS builds are automatically restricted within the IP ranges listed here. In other words, you do not have to explicitly set `circleci_ip_ranges: true` for macOS builds.

*macOS IP ranges are not included in the machine-consumable lists maintained in DNS.* Refer to the list above for the most up-to-date macOS IP addresses. Information about changes to macOS IP ranges will be included in the link:https://circleci.com/changelog/[changelog] and will be sent to the technical contact(s) listed under menu:Organization Settings[Overview].
