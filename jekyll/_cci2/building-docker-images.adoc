:page-description: How to build Docker images using the Docker execution environment
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:

Use the remote Docker environment (`setup_remote_docker`) to build Docker images in the Docker execution environment. When you use the remote Docker environment for a job, any Docker commands you run in your job execute locally on the virtual machine used to spin up your primary Docker container.

NOTE: The _remote_ in "remote Docker" is a legacy term from when remote Docker usage would spin up a separate, remote environment for running Docker commands.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

To build Docker images for deployment using the Docker execution environment, you must use the `setup_remote_docker` key. If your job requires `docker` or `docker-compose` commands, add the `setup_remote_docker` step into your `.circleci/config.yml`:

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2022.06
    steps:
      # ... steps for building/testing app ...
      - setup_remote_docker
----

When `setup_remote_docker` executes, any Docker commands you use will execute locally on the virtual machine used to spin up containers for your job.

In the CircleCI web app, jobs that run in the remote Docker environment have the **Remote Docker** label.

NOTE: The use of the `setup_remote_docker` key is reserved for configs in which your primary executor _is_ a Docker container. If your executor is `machine` (and you want to use docker commands in your config) you do *not* need to use the `setup_remote_docker` key. For an example, see <<run-docker-commands-using-the-machine-executor,Run Docker commands using the `machine` executor>>.

[#specifications]
== Specifications

For technical specifications and pricing information for the remote Docker environment, see link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/changes-to-remote-docker-reporting-pricing/47759[Discuss]. For CircleCI server installations, contact the systems administrator for specifications.

[#run-docker-commands-using-the-docker-executor]
== Run Docker commands using the Docker executor

The example below shows how you can build and deploy a Docker image for our link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-docker[demo docker project] using the Docker executor, with remote Docker:

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.17
    resource_class: xlarge
    steps:
      - checkout
      # ... steps for building/testing app ...

      - setup_remote_docker:
          docker_layer_caching: true

      # build and push Docker image
      - run: |
          TAG=0.1.$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM
          docker build -t CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-docker:$TAG .
          echo $DOCKER_PASS | docker login -u $DOCKER_USER --password-stdin
          docker push CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-docker:$TAG
----

Below is a break down of what is happening during this build's execution:

* All commands execute in the xref:glossary#primary-container[primary-container]. (line 5)
* Once you call `setup_remote_docker`, all Docker-related commands execute locally. (line 12)
* Enable xref:glossary#docker-layer-caching[Docker Layer Caching] (DLC) to speed up image building. (line 14)
* We use xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[project environment variables] to store credentials for Docker Hub. (line 19)

[#resource-classes]
=== Resource classes

NOTE: *Arm on Docker* For pricing information, and a list of CircleCI Docker convenience images that support Arm resource classes, see the link:https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/[Resource classes page].

The resource class for the remote Docker environment is determined by the configuration of the primary container.

For *x86* architecture the equivalent Linux VM resource class is used for remote Docker, relative to how the primary container is configured, apart from if you are using `small` or `medium+`, in which case `medium` and `large` are used, respectively. For a full list of available Linux VM resource classes see the xref:configuration-reference#linuxvm-execution-environment[Configuration Reference].

For *Arm*, the equivalent Arm VM resource class will be used. For a full list of available Arm VM resource classes see the xref:configuration-reference#arm-execution-environment[Configuration Reference].

For credit/pricing information, see the link:https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/[Resource class product page].

[#install-the-docker-cli]
== Install the Docker CLI

The xref:circleci-images#[CircleCI convenience images] for the Docker executor come with the Docker CLI pre-installed. If you are using a third-party image for your primary container that doesn't already have the Docker CLI installed, then link:https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms[you will need to install it] as part of your job before calling any `docker` commands.

[,yml]
----
      # Install via apk on alpine based images
      - run:
          name: Install Docker client
          command: apk add docker-cli
----

[#docker-version]
== Specify a Docker version for remote docker

To optionally specify a Docker version, you can set it as a `version` attribute with supported tags:

[,yml]
----
      - setup_remote_docker:
          version: edge
----

CircleCI supports the tags listed below for remote Docker, as per our link:{{site.baseurl}}/remote-docker-images-support-policy/#tagging[Remote Docker tagging policy].

For *x86* and *arm* architecture, the following tags are available:

* `default`
* `edge`
* `previous`

The above tags resolve to the latest supported Docker version, which is currently Docker 24.

To use Docker 23, the previous Docker release, use the following tag:

* `docker23`

To use Docker 24, patch updates will occur until Docker 25 is released, use the following tag:

* `docker24`

To use the current deprecated version, Docker 20, use `20.10.24`

NOTE: The `version` key is not currently supported on CircleCI server installations. Contact your system administrator for information about the Docker version installed in your remote Docker environment.

[#run-docker-commands-using-the-machine-executor]
== Run Docker commands using the machine executor

The example below shows how you can build a Docker image using the `machine` executor with the default image - this does not require the use of remote Docker:

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
 build:
   machine:
    image: ubuntu-2204:2022.04.2
   steps:
     - checkout
     # start proprietary DB using private Docker image
     # with credentials stored in the UI
     - run: |
         echo "$DOCKER_PASS" | docker login --username $DOCKER_USER --password-stdin
         docker run -d --name db company/proprietary-db:1.2.3

     # build the application image
     - run: docker build -t company/app:$CIRCLE_BRANCH .

     # deploy the image
     - run: docker push company/app:$CIRCLE_BRANCH
----
