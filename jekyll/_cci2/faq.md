## General

### Does CircleCI look at my code?
{:.no_toc}
CircleCI employees never look at your code without permission. If you have requested support, a support engineer may ask permission to look at your code to help you debug the problem.

See the CircleCI [security policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/security/) for more details.

## Migration

### Why migrate from CircleCI 1.0 to 2.0?
{:.no_toc}
- CircleCI 2.0 includes a significant rewrite of container utilization to run more jobs faster and to prevent available containers from sitting idle.
- In 2.0, Jobs are broken into Steps. Compose these Steps within a Job at your discretion, giving you greater flexibility to run your build the way you want.
- 2.0 Jobs support almost all public Docker images and custom images with your own dependencies specified.

### How do I migrate from Jenkins to CircleCI 2.0?
{:.no_toc}
Start with the [Hello World doc]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/hello-world/), then add `steps:` to duplicate your project exactly as it is in Jenkins, for example:

```yaml
    steps:
      - run: echo "Add any bash command you want here"
      - run:
          command: |
            echo "Arbitrary multi-line bash"
            echo "Probably copy-pasted from 'Execute Shell' on Jenkins"
```

Refer to [Migrating From Jenkins]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/migrating-from-jenkins/) for conceptual differences between Jenkins and CircleCI.           

### Does CircleCI 2.0 run inference commands?
{:.no_toc}
CircleCI 2.0 does not infer from your project and is moving toward a model of smart defaults with a configuration builder interface to assist with configuring all jobs in the `config.yml` file.

### Can I use CircleCI 2.0 without creating base images?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, you can use one of ours! For now, but this image may be deprecated in a future release.

The `circleci/build-image:ubuntu-14.04-XL-922-9410082` image has the same content as the Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 image our web app uses. Just know that the image is fairly large (around 17.5 GB uncompressed), so it’s less ideal for local testing.

The image defaults to running actions as the `ubuntu` user and is designed to work with network services provided by Docker Compose.

Here’s a [list of languages and tools]({{site.baseurl}}/1.0/build-image-ubuntu-14.04-XL-922-9410082/) included in the image.

## Hosting

### Is CircleCI 2.0 available to enterprise clients?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, CircleCI 2.0 is now available to enterprise clients, see [Administrator's Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/overview) for details and links to installation instructions.

### What are the differences between CircleCI’s hosting options?
{:.no_toc}
- **Cloud** - CircleCI manages the setup, infrastructure, security and maintenance of your services. You get instant access to new feature releases and automatic upgrades, alleviating the need for manual work on an internal system.

- **Server** - You install and manage CircleCI, through a service like AWS, behind a firewall that your team sets up and maintains according to your datacenter policy. You have full administrative control for complete customization and manage upgrades as new versions are released.

### Why did you change the name from CircleCI Enterprise?
{:.no_toc}
The term Enterprise was used to refer to the behind-the-firewall option. However, this nomenclature was confusing for customers and for CircleCI employees.

CircleCI is one product that can be accessed through our cloud service, installed behind your firewall, or in a hybrid approach, depending on your needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Why aren't my jobs running when I push commits?
{:.no_toc}
In the CircleCI application, check the Workflows tab for error messages. More often than not, the error is because of formatting errors in your `config.yml` file.

See [Writing YAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/writing-yaml/) for more details.

After checking your `config.yml` for formatting errors, search for your issue in the [CircleCI support center](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us).

### What is the difference between a usage queue and a run queue?
{:.no_toc}
A **usage queue** forms when an organization lacks the containers to run a build. The number of available containers is determined by the plan chosen when setting up a project on CircleCI. If your builds are queuing often, you can add more containers by changing your plan.

A **run queue** forms when CircleCI experiences high demand. Customer builds are placed in a run queue and processed as machines become available.

In other words, you can reduce time spent in a **usage queue** by [purchasing more containers](#how-do-i-upgrade-my-container-plan-with-more-containers-to-prevent-queuing), but time spent in a **run queue** is unavoidable (though CircleCI aims to keep this as low as possible).

### Why are my builds queuing even though I'm on Performance Plan?
{:.no_toc}
In order to keep the system stable for all CircleCI customers, we implement different soft concurrency limits on each of the [resource classes](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class). If you are experiencing queuing on your builds, it's possible you are hitting these limits. Please [contact CircleCI support](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to request raises on these limits.

### Why can't I find my project on the Add Project page?
{:.no_toc}
If you are not seeing a project you would like to build and it is not currently building on CircleCI, check your org in the top left corner of the CircleCI application.  For instance, if the top left shows your user `my-user`, only GitHub projects belonging to `my-user` will be available under `Add Projects`.  If you want to build the GitHub project `your-org/project`, you must change your org on the application Switch Organization menu to `your-org`.

### I got an error saying "You have met the maximum number of active users allowed for your plan per billing period."
{:.no_toc}
Configure your plan and add user seats to ensure your organization has enough seats for future billing periods. If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to billing@circleci.com.

### I got an error saying my “build didn’t run because it needs more containers than your plan allows” but my plan has more than enough. Why is this failing?
{:.no_toc}
There is a default setting within CircleCI to initially limit project parallelism to 16. If you request more than that, it will fail. Contact [Support or your Customer Success Manager](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us) to have it increased.

### How do Docker image names work? Where do they come from?
{:.no_toc}
CircleCI 2.0 currently supports pulling (and pushing with Docker Engine) Docker images from [Docker Hub][docker-hub]. For [official images][docker-library], you can pull by simply specifying the name of the image and a tag:

```
golang:1.7.1-jessie
redis:3.0.7-jessie
```

For public images on Docker Hub, you can pull the image by prefixing the account or team username:

```
my-user/couchdb:1.6.1
```

### What is the best practice for specifying image versions?
{:.no_toc}
It is best practice **not** to use the `latest` tag for specifying image versions. It is also best practice to use a specific version and tag, for example `circleci/ruby:2.4-jessie-node`, to pin down the image and prevent upstream changes to your containers when the underlying base distro changes. Specifying only `circleci/ruby:2.4` could result in unexpected changes from `jessie` to `stretch` for example. For more context, refer to the [Docker Image Best Practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/#docker-image-best-practices) section of the Choosing an Executor Type document and the Best Practices section of the [CircleCI Images]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/circleci-images/#best-practices) document.

### How can I set the timezone in Docker images?
{:.no_toc}
You can set the timezone in Docker images with the `TZ` environment variable. In your `.circleci/config.yml`, it would look like:

A sample `.circleci/config.yml` with a defined `TZ` variable would look like this:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: your/primary-image:version-tag
      - image: mysql:5.7
        environment:
           TZ: "America/Los_Angeles"
    working_directory: ~/your-dir
    environment:
      TZ: "America/Los_Angeles"
```

In this example, the timezone is set for both the primary image and an additional mySQL image.

A full list of available timezone options is [available on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## Workflows

### Can I use the API with Workflows?
{:.no_toc}
Yes. Refer to the [Enabling Pipelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/build-processing/) document for instructions and links to the API endpoint.

### Can I use the Auto-cancel feature with Workflows?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, see the [Skipping and Cancelling Builds]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/skip-build/) document for instructions.

### Can I use `store_test_results` with Workflows?
{:.no_toc}
You can use `store_test_results` in order to populate your Test Summary section with test results information and for [timing-based test-splitting]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/#splitting-by-timing-data). Test timings data is available for 2.0 with Workflows, using data from a job with the same name going back 50 builds.

### Can I use Workflows with CircleCI 1.0?
 {:.no_toc}
This feature only exists on CircleCI 2.0. In order to use Workflows, you must first be building on CircleCI 2.0.

### Can I use Workflows with the Installable CircleCI?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, Workflows are available in CircleCI as part of the 2.0 option for enterprise clients. Refer to the [Administrator's Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/overview) for installation instructions.

### How many jobs can I run at one time?
{:.no_toc}
The number of containers in your plan determines the number of jobs that may be run at one time. For example, if you have ten workflow jobs ready to run, but only five containers in your plan, only five jobs will run.
Using Workflow config you can run multiple jobs at once or sequentially. You can fan-out (run multiple jobs at once) or fan-in (wait for all the jobs to complete before executing the dependent job).

### Do you plan to add the ability to launch jobs on both Linux and Mac environments in the same workflow?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, this is supported. See the section for multiple executor types in the [Sample 2.0 `config.yml` Files]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/sample-config/#sample-configuration-with-multiple-executor-types-macos--docker) document.

### Is it possible to split the `config.yml` into different files?
{:.no_toc}
Splitting `config.yml` into multiple files is not yet supported.

### Can I build only the jobs that changed?
{:.no_toc}
No.

### Can I build fork PR’s using Workflows?
{:.no_toc}
Yes!

### Can workflows be scheduled to run at a specific time of day?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, for the CircleCI hosted application. For example, to run a workflow at 4 PM use `"0 16 * * *"` as the value for the `cron:` key. Times are interpreted in the UTC time zone.

### What time zone is used for schedules?
{:.no_toc}
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the time zone in which schedules are interpreted.

### Why didn’t my scheduled build run?
{:.no_toc}
You must specify exactly the branches on which the scheduled workflow will run and push that 'config.yml' to the branch you want to build. A push on the `master` branch will only schedule a workflow for the `master` branch.

### Can I schedule multiple workflows?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, every workflow with a `schedule` listed in the `trigger:` key will be run on the configured schedule.

### Are scheduled workflows guaranteed to run at precisely the time scheduled?
{:.no_toc}
CircleCI provides no guarantees about precision. A scheduled workflow will be run as though a commit was pushed at the configured time.

## Windows

### What do I need to get started building on Windows?
{:.no_toc}
You will need a [Performance Plan](https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/) as well as having [Pipelines enabled]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/build-processing/) for your project. Windows jobs are charged at 40 credits/minute.

### What exact version of Windows are you using?
{:.no_toc}

We use Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Edition, the Server Core option.

### What is installed on the machine?
{:.no_toc}

The [full list of available dependencies]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/hello-world-windows/#software-pre-installed-in-the-windows-image) can be found in our "[Hello World On
Windows]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/hello-world-windows/)" document.

### What is the machine size?
{:.no_toc}

The Windows machines have 4 vCPUs and 15GB RAM.

### Is Windows available on installed versions of CircleCI?
{:.no_toc}

Unfortunately, Windows is not available on server installed versions of CircleCI at this time.

## Billing

### Credit Usage Plans

#### How do the new pricing plans affect me as a customer?
{:.no_toc}
For the vast majority of customers, you can keep your current plan for now and this simply represents a new option you may want to consider.

#### What are credits?
{:.no_toc}
Credits are used to pay for your usage based on machine type and size. Credits
can also be used to pay for features, such as Docker Layer Caching.

For example, the 25,000 credit package would provide 2,500 build minutes when
using a single machine at the default rate of 10 credits per minute. The same package would last 1,250 minutes when using 2x parallelism or 250 minutes at 10x parallelism.

#### Is there a way to share plans across organizations and have them billed centrally?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, similarly with container-based plans, you can go to the Settings > Share & Transfer > Share Plan page of the CircleCI app to select the Orgs you want to add to your plan. The child organizations will bill all credits and other usage to the parent org.

#### If a container is used for under one minute, do I have to pay for a full minute?
{:.no_toc}
You pay to the next nearest credit. First we round up to the nearest second, and then up to the nearest credit.

#### How do I buy credits? Can I buy in any increments?
{:.no_toc}
Every month, you are charged for your selected credit package at the beginning of the month.

#### What do I pay for?
{:.no_toc}
You can choose to pay for premium features per active user, compute, and optionally, premium support.


- Access to features, such as new machine sizes, are paid with a monthly fee of $15 per active user (not including applicable taxes).
- Compute is paid for monthly in credits for the machine size and duration you use:
  - Credits are sold in packages of 25,000 at $15 each (not including applicable taxes).
  - Credits rollover each month and expire after one year.
- Docker Layer Caching (DLC) is paid for with credits per usage, similar to
  compute credits.

  
#### Why does CircleCI have per-active-user pricing? 
{:.no_toc}

Credit usage covers access to compute. We prefer to keep usage costs as low as possible to encourage frequent job runs, which is the foundation of a good CI practice. Per-active-user fees cover access to platform features and job orchestration. This includes features like dependency caching, artifact caching, and workspaces, all of which speed up build times without incurring additional compute cost.

#### What constitutes an _Active User_?
{:.no_toc}

An `active user` is any user who triggers the use of compute resources on non-OSS projects. This includes activities such as:

- Commits from users that trigger builds, including PR Merge commits.
- Re-running jobs in the CircleCI web application, including [SSH debug]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/ssh-access-jobs).
- Approving [manual jobs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows/#holding-a-workflow-for-a-manual-approval) (approver will be considered the actor of all downstream jobs).
- Using scheduled workflows
- Machine users

**Note:** If your project is [open-source]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/oss) you will **not** be considered an active user.

To find a list of your Active User's, Log in to the CircleCI web app > click `Settings` > click `Plan Usage` > click on the `Users` tab.

#### What happens when I run out of credits?
{:.no_toc}

On the Performance plan, when you reach 10% of your remaining credits, you will
be refilled 25% of your credit subscription (at 25% the cost of your plan). For
example, If your monthly package size is 25,000 credits, you will automatically
be refilled 6,250 credits (at $.0006 each, not including applicable taxes) when
you reach 2,500 remaining credits.

If you notice that your account is receiving repeated refills, you can review your credit usage by navigating to the settings tab of your account and clicking on “Plan Usage."

#### Do credits expire?
{:.no_toc}
**Performance Plan**: Credits expire one year after purchase. Unused credits will be forfeited when the account subscription is canceled.

#### How do I pay?
{:.no_toc}
You can pay from inside the CircleCI app for monthly pricing.

#### When do I pay?
{:.no_toc}

On the Usage plans, at the beginning of your billing cycle, you will be charged for user seats, premium support tiers and your monthly credit allocation. Any subsequent credit refills _during_ the month (such as the auto-refilling back to 25% on reaching 10% of credits available) will be paid _at the time of the refill_.

#### What are the other renewal dates?
{:.no_toc}

The first credit card charge on the day you upgrade to a paid plan or change paid plans, in addition to the following charges from CircleCI:

- On the monthly renewal date if your team is on the monthly plan.
- On the annual renewal date if your team is on the annual plan.
- On the last day of the month if your team is on the annual plan and there is an outstanding balance from adding new users or utilizing more credits.
- If you are on the Performance plan, anytime your team’s credit balance drops below your preset limit, another credit purchase will be processed.

#### Are there credit plans for open source projects?
{:.no_toc}

Open source organizations **on our free plan** receive 400,000 free credits per month that can be spent on Linux open source projects, using a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs. 

If you build on macOS, we also offer organizations on our free plan 25,000 free credits per month to use on macOS open source builds. For access to this, contact our team at billing@circleci.com. Free credits for macOS open source builds can be used on a maximum of 2 concurrent jobs per organization.

#### I currently get free credits for open source projects on my container plan. How do I get discounts for open source on the Performance plan?
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI no longer offers discounts for open source customers on the Performance plan.

#### Why does CircleCI charge for Docker layer caching? 
{:.no_toc}
 
Docker layer caching (DLC) reduces build times on pipelines where Docker images are
built by only rebuilding Docker layers that have changed (read more about DLC
[here]({{site.baseurl}})/2.0/docker-layer-caching). DLC costs 200 credits per
job run.

There are a few things that CircleCI does to ensure DLC is available to
customers. We use solid-state drives and replicate the cache across zones to
make sure DLC is available. We will also increase the cache as needed in order
to manage concurrent requests and make DLC available for your jobs. All of these
optimizations incur additional cost for CircleCI with our compute providers,
which pass along to customers when they use DLC.

To estimate your DLC cost, look at the jobs in your config file with Docker
layer caching enabled, and the number of Docker images you are building in those
jobs. There are cases where a job can be written once in a config file but the
job runs multiple times in a pipeline, for example, with parallelism enabled.

Note that the benefits of Docker layer caching are only apparent on pipelines
that are building Docker images, and reduces image build times by reusing the
unchanged layers of the application image built during your job. If your
pipeline does not include a job where Docker images are built, Docker layer
caching will provide no benefit.

### Container Based Plans

#### What if I go over the minutes allotted for a Container-based macOS plan?

Minutes and overages ensure we can stabilize capacity while offering as much power as possible which should hopefully lead to the greatest possible utility all around.

Overages are as follows:
- Seed & Startup: .08/minute
- Growth: .05/minute

Users will be alerted in-app as they approach the limit and upon passing their respective limit.

Reach out to billing@circleci.com with any additional questions.

#### How do I upgrade my container plan with more containers to prevent queuing?
{:.no_toc}
* Linux: Go to the Settings > Plan Settings page of the CircleCI app to increase the number of containers on your Linux plan. Type the increased number of containers in the entry field under the Choose Linux Plan heading and click the Pay Now button to enter your payment details. 

* macOS: Go to the Settings > Plan Settings page of the CircleCI app and click the macOS tab in the upper-right. Then, click the Pay Now button on the Startup, Growth, or Mobile Focused plan to enter your payment details.

#### Is there a way to share plans across organizations and have them billed centrally?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, go to the Settings > Share & Transfer > Share Plan page of the CircleCI app to select the Orgs you want to add to your plan.

#### Can I set up billing for an organization, without binding it to my personal account?
{:.no_toc}
Yes, the billing is associated with the organization. You can buy while within that org's context from that org's settings page. But, you must have another GitHub Org Admin who will take over if you unfollow all projects. We are working on a better solution for this in a future update.

#### What is the definition of a container in the context of billing?
{:.no_toc}
A container is a 2 CPU 4GB RAM machine that you pay for access to. Containers may be used for concurrent tasks (for example, running five different jobs) or for parallelism (for example, splitting one job across five different tasks, all running at the same time). Both examples would use five containers.

#### Why am I being charged for remote Docker spin up time? 
{:.no_toc}
When CircleCI spins up a remote docker instance, it requires the primary container to be running and spending compute. Thus while you are not charged for the remote docker instance itself, you are charged for the time that the primary container is up.

---

## Architecture

### Can I use IPv6 in my tests?
{:.no_toc}
You can use the [machine executor]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types) for testing local IPv6 traffic.  Unfortunately, we do not support IPv6 internet traffic, as not all of our cloud providers offer IPv6 support.

Hosts running with machine executor are configured with IPv6 addresses for `eth0` and `lo` network interfaces.

You can also configure Docker to assign IPv6 address to containers, to test services with IPv6 setup.  You can enable it globally by configuring docker daemon like the following:

```yaml
   ipv6_tests:
     machine: true
     steps:
     - checkout
     - run:
         name: enable ipv6
         command: |
           cat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
           {
             "ipv6": true,
             "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:1::/64"
           }
           EOF
           sudo service docker restart
```

Docker allows enabling IPv6 at different levels: [globally via daemon config like above](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/), with [`docker network create` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/), and with [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#enable_ipv6).


### What operating systems does CircleCI 2.0 support?
