## Does CircleCI 2.0 run inference commands?

Currently, CircleCI 2.0 doesn't infer anything from your project, but we have plans to replace our inference system before moving out of Beta. Until then, you'll need to manually configure all jobs.

## My project is running on CircleCI 2.0, but the build is frozen!

Builds often freeze due to syntax errors in `config.yml`.

Cancel the build, check your `config.yml` for proper indentation, and ensure that all jobs and steps have the required keys.

## Can I use CircleCI 2.0 without creating base images?

Yes, you can use* one of ours!

The `circleci/build-image:ubuntu-14.04-XL-922-9410082` image has the same content as the Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 image our web app uses. Just know that the image is fairly large (around 17.5 GB uncompressed), so it’s less ideal for local testing.

The image defaults to running actions as the `ubuntu` user and is designed to work with network services provided by Docker Compose.

Here’s a [list of languages and tools]({{site.baseurl}}/1.0/build-image-ubuntu-14.04-XL-922-9410082/) included in the image.

\*For now. The idea of a monolithic build image doesn’t fit well with the ethos of CircleCI 2.0, so we will eventually deprecate it.

## How do Docker image names work? Where do they come from?

CircleCI 2.0 currently supports pulling (and pushing with Docker Engine) Docker images from [Docker Hub][docker-hub]. For [official images][docker-library], you can pull by simply specifying the name of the image and a tag:

```YAML
golang:1.7.1
redis:3.0.7
```

For public images on Docker Hub, you can pull the image by prefixing the account/team username:

```YAML
myUsername/couchdb:1.6.1
```

## Can I use the `latest` tag when specifying image versions?

We highly recommend that you don’t. Read more about why we think you should [Avoid Mutable Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/#avoid-mutable-tags)

## I updated my Docker image, but my build is using a cached image. How can I invalidate the old image?

We don’t currently provide a way to invalidate cached Docker images. One way around this is to use image tags.

If you’re running a build on `my-image:123` and you update the image, you can use a new tag to force a cache refresh. In this example, you could change the tag to `my-image:456` and choose that image in `config.yml`.
