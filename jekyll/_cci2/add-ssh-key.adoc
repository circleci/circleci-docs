:icons: font
:experimental:

If deploying to your servers requires SSH access, you will need to add SSH keys to CircleCI.

[NOTE]
====
**GitHub authorization with CircleCI is changing**. Starting August, 2023 when you authorize your CircleCI account with GitHub, this will be done through our GitHub App, rather than the GitHub OAuth app. You can see which account type you have by heading to the CircleCI web app and inspecting the URL in your browser:

* This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the **GitHub App**: `https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/circleci`
* This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the **GitHub OAuth app**: `https://app.circleci.com/github`

For more information about the differences, see the link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps[GitHub docs comparison page].

[#overview]
== Overview

If you want to set up an SSH key in order to checkout code from additional repositories in GitHub (xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app only]) or Bitbucket within a job, refer to the xref:github-integration#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories[GitHub] or xref:bitbucket-integration#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories[Bitbucket] integration pages.  If you need additional SSH keys to access other services and your org is set up to the use xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app] or BitBucket, follow the steps below.

If you want to set up an SSH key in order to checkout code from additional repositories or to access other services from within your job and your org is authorized with GitHub App or you use GitLab as your VCS, follow the steps below to add an SSH key to your project.

You may need to add the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in order to add SSH keys.

[#steps-to-add-additional-ssh-keys]
== Steps to add additional SSH keys

Since CircleCI cannot decrypt SSH keys, every new key must have an empty passphrase. The below examples are for macOS. See link:https://help.github.com/articlesgenerating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/[GitHub] or link:https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-ssh-and-two-step-verification/[Bitbucket] documentation for additional details on creating SSH keys.

. In a terminal, generate the key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`. See link:https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/[Secure Shell documentation] for additional details.
. In the CircleCI application, go to your project's settings by clicking the *Project Settings* button (top-right on the *Pipelines* page of the project).
. On the *Project Settings* page, click on *SSH Keys*.
. Scroll down to the *Additional SSH Keys* section.
. Click the *Add SSH Key* button.
. In the *Hostname* field, enter the key's associated host (for example, `git.heroku.com`). If you do not specify a hostname, the key will be used for all hosts.
. In the *Private Key* field, paste the SSH key you are adding.
. Click the *Add SSH Key* button.

[#add-ssh-keys-to-a-job]
== Add SSH Keys to a Job

Even though all CircleCI jobs use `ssh-agent` to automatically sign all added SSH keys, you *must* use the `add_ssh_keys` key to actually add keys to a container.

To add a set of SSH keys to a container, use the `add_ssh_keys` xref:configuration-reference#add_ssh_keys[special step] within the appropriate xref:jobs-steps#[job] in your configuration file. The fingerprint can be SHA256 or MD5. SHA256 fingerprints should be prefixed with `SHA256:` and MD5 fingerprints should include the colons between character pairs. When you add your key to CircleCI in menu:Project Settings[SSH keys > Additional SSH keys] the SHA256 fingerprint will be visible.

CAUTION: **Using server?** Only MD5 fingerprints are supported. In CircleCI in menu:Project Settings[SSH keys > Additional SSH keys] the MD5 fingerprint will be visible. SHA256 support is planned for an upcoming server release.

For a self-hosted runner, ensure that you have an `ssh-agent` on your system to successfully use the `add_ssh_keys` step. The SSH key is written to `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_<fingerprint>`, where `$HOME` is the home directory of the user configured to execute jobs, and `<fingerprint>` is the MD5 fingerprint of the key. A host entry is also appended to `$HOME/.ssh/config`, along with a relevant `IdentityFile` option to use the key.

----

All fingerprints in the `fingerprints` list must correspond to keys that have been added through the CircleCI application. Fingerprints in CircleCI environment variables will fail.

To checkout additional repositories from within your job, ensure that you run the `checkout` command *before* `add_ssh_keys`; otherwise, `CIRCLE_CI_REPOSITORY_URL` will be empty.  Also ensure that the private key is added to the CircleCI project and that the public key has been added to the additional repositories that you want to checkout from within your job.

[#adding-multiple-keys-with-blank-hostnames]
== Adding multiple keys with blank hostnames

If you need to add multiple SSH keys with blank hostnames to your project, you will need to make some changes to the default SSH configuration provided by CircleCI. In the scenario where you have multiple SSH keys that have access to the same hosts, but are for different purposes the default `IdentitiesOnly no` is set causing connections to use ssh-agent. This will always cause the first key to be used, even if that is the incorrect key. If you have added the SSH key to a container, you will need to either set `IdentitiesOnly no` in the appropriate block, or you can remove all keys from the ssh-agent for this job using `ssh-add -D`, and reading the key added with `ssh-add /path/to/key`.
