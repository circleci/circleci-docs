:page-description: How to add additional SSH keys to CircleCI
:icons: font
:experimental:

Add additional SSH keys to your project for access to deploy other services or to write to, or checkout code from other repositories.

If you want to set up an SSH key in order to checkout code from additional repositories in GitHub (xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app only]) or Bitbucket Cloud within a job, refer to the xref:github-integration#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories[GitHub OAuth app] or xref:bitbucket-integration#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories[Bitbucket Cloud] integration pages.  If you need additional SSH keys to access other services and your org is set up to the use xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app] or Bitbucket Cloud, follow the steps below.

You may need to add the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in order to add SSH keys.

[#steps-to-add-additional-ssh-keys]
== 1. Add an additional SSH key to your project

CircleCI cannot decrypt SSH keys, therefore every new key must have an empty passphrase. The below examples are for macOS.

. In a terminal, generate the key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`. See link:https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/[Secure Shell documentation] for additional details.
. In the CircleCI application, go to your project's settings by clicking the *Project Settings* button (top-right on the *Pipelines* page of the project).
. On the *Project Settings* page, select *SSH Keys*.
. Scroll down to the *Additional SSH Keys* section.
+
If you have a GitLab integration, you will find that an additional SSH key already exists. This was created automatically by CircleCI during the project creation process. This key is used to checkout your code so it should not be removed.
. Select *Add SSH Key*.
. In the *Hostname* field, enter the key's associated host (for example, `git.heroku.com`). If you do not specify a hostname, the key will be used for all hosts.
. In the *Private Key* field, paste the SSH key you are adding.
. Select *Add SSH Key*.

[#add-ssh-keys-to-a-job]
== 2. Add SSH keys to a job

Even though all CircleCI jobs use `ssh-agent` to automatically sign all added SSH keys, you *must* use the `add_ssh_keys` key to actually add keys to a container.

To add a set of SSH keys to a container, use the `add_ssh_keys` xref:configuration-reference#add-ssh-keys[special step] within the appropriate xref:jobs-steps#[job] in your configuration file. The fingerprint can be SHA256 or MD5. SHA256 fingerprints should be prefixed with `SHA256:` and MD5 fingerprints should include the colons between character pairs. When you add your key to CircleCI in menu:Project Settings[SSH keys > Additional SSH keys] the SHA256 fingerprint will be visible.

CAUTION: **Using server?** Only MD5 fingerprints are supported. In CircleCI in menu:Project Settings[SSH keys > Additional SSH keys] the MD5 fingerprint will be visible. SHA256 support is planned for an upcoming server release.

For a self-hosted runner, ensure that you have an `ssh-agent` on your system to successfully use the `add_ssh_keys` step. The SSH key is written to `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_<fingerprint>`, where `$HOME` is the home directory of the user configured to execute jobs, and `<fingerprint>` is the MD5 fingerprint of the key. A host entry is also appended to `$HOME/.ssh/config`, along with a relevant `IdentityFile` option to use the key.

            - "SHA256:NPj4IcXxqQEKGXOghi/QbG2sohoNfvZ30JwCcdSSNM0"
----

All fingerprints in the `fingerprints` list must correspond to keys that have been added through the CircleCI application. Fingerprints in CircleCI environment variables will fail.

To checkout additional repositories from within your job, ensure that you run the `checkout` command *before* `add_ssh_keys`; otherwise, `CIRCLE_CI_REPOSITORY_URL` will be empty.  Also ensure that the private key is added to the CircleCI project and that the public key has been added to the additional repositories that you want to checkout from within your job.

[#adding-multiple-keys-with-blank-hostnames]
== Adding multiple keys with blank hostnames

If you need to add multiple SSH keys with blank hostnames to your project, you will need to make some changes to the default SSH configuration provided by CircleCI. In the scenario where you have multiple SSH keys that have access to the same hosts, but are for different purposes the default `IdentitiesOnly no` is set causing connections to use `ssh-agent`. This will always cause the first key to be used, even if that is the incorrect key. If you have added the SSH key to a container, you will need to either set `IdentitiesOnly no` in the appropriate block, or you can remove all keys from the `ssh-agent` for this job using `ssh-add -D`, and reading the key added with `ssh-add /path/to/key`.
