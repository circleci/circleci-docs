[#configure-the-jira-orb]
=== Configure the Jira orb

The link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/jira[`circleci/jira`] orb is responsible for relaying information about your build or deployment to the CircleCI Jira application.

. Begin by saving the *Webhook URL* from the previous section as an _environment variable_. This could be added as a xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[Project Environment Variable] or within a xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-context[Context]. We recommend naming the variable `JIRA_WEBHOOK_URL`.

. Next, import the Jira orb into your `.circleci/config.yml` file and implement the `jira/notify` command at the _end_ of your build and deployment jobs. Detailed and up-to-date configuration examples can be found on the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/jira#usage-examples[orb page].

[#view-build-and-deploy-statuses-in-jira]
== View build and deploy statuses in Jira

The link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/jira[`circleci/jira`] orb automatically detects the Jira ticket number from the branch name or commit message. The build or deployment status is then posted to the appropriate Jira ticket. You can view build and deployment information, natively, in the right sidebar of any Jira ticket.
