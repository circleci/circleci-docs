[#introduction]
== Introduction

A configuration file that uses the deprecated `deploy` step _must_ be converted, and _all_ instances of the `deploy` step must be removed, regardless of whether or not xref:parallelism-faster-jobs#[parallelism] is used in the job.

- *Does your job have parallelism of 1?* Swap out the `deploy` key for the xref:configuration-reference#run[`run`] key. Nothing more is needed to migrate.

- *Does your job have parallelism > 1?* There is no direct replacement for the `deploy` step if you are using `parallelism > 1` in your job. The recommendation is to create two separate jobs within one workflow - a test job, and a deploy job. The test job will run the tests in parallel, and the deploy job will depend on the test job. The test job has `parallelism > 1`, and the deploy job will have the command from the previous `deploy` step replaced with `run` and no parallelism. See examples in this guide.

== Parallelism > 1
The following is an example of replacing the deprecated `deploy` step in a configuration file that has `parallelism > 1`.

CAUTION: The code in the first example below is deprecated. Do not copy.

```yml
# Example of deprecated syntax, do not copy
version: 2.1
jobs:
  deploy-step-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    parallelism: 3
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Say hello"
          command: "echo Hello, World!"
      - run:
          name: "Write random data"
          command: openssl rand -hex 4 > rand_${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}.txt
      - run:
          name: "Emulate doing things"
          command: |
            if [[ "$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX" != "0" ]]; then
              sleep 30
            fi
      - deploy: #deprecated deploy step, do not copy
          command: |
            echo "this is a deploy step which needs data from the rand"
            cat rand_*.txt

workflows:
  deploy-step-workflow:
    jobs:
      - deploy-step-job
```

If you are entirely reliant on external resources (for example, Docker containers pushed to a registry), you can extract the `deploy` step above as a job, which requires `doing-things-job` to complete. `doing-things-job` uses parallelism of 3, while `deploy-step-job` performs the actual deployment. See example below.

```yml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  doing-things-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    parallelism: 3
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Say hello"
          command: "echo Hello, World!"
      - run:
          name: "Write random data"
          command: openssl rand -hex 4 > rand_${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}.txt
      - run:
          name: "Emulate doing things"
          command: |
            if [[ "$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX" != "0" ]]; then
              sleep 30
            fi
  # create a new job with the deploy step in it
  deploy-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - run: # change "deploy" to "run"
          command: |
            echo "this is a deploy step"

workflows:
  deploy-step-workflow:
    jobs:
      - doing-things-job
      # add your new job and make it depend on the
      # "doing-things-job"
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - doing-things-job
```

[#using-workspaces]
=== Using workspaces

If files are needed from `doing-things-job` in the `deploy-job`, use xref:workspaces#[workspaces]. This enables sharing of files between two jobs so that the `deploy-job` can access them. See example below.

```yml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  doing-things-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    parallelism: 3
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Say hello"
          command: "echo Hello, World!"
      - run:
          name: "Write random data"
          command: openssl rand -hex 4 > rand_${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}.txt
      - run:
          name: "Emulate doing things"
          command: |
            if [[ "$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX" != "0" ]]; then
              sleep 30
            fi
      # save the files your deploy step needs
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: .     # relative path to our working directory
          paths:      # file globs which will be persisted to the workspace
           - rand_*

  deploy-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      # attach the files you persisted in the doing-things-job
      - attach_workspace:
          at: . # relative path to our working directory
      - run:
          command: |
            echo "this is a deploy step"

workflows:
  deploy-step-workflow:
    jobs:
      - doing-things-job
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - doing-things-job
```

This is effectively using a "fan-in" workflow which is described in detail on the xref:workflows#fan-outfan-in-workflow-example[workflows] page.

WARNING: Support for the deprecated `deploy` step will eventually be removed. Ample time will be given for customers to migrate their configuration.
