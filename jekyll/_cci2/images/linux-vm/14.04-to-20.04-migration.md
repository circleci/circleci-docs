## Changes
{: #changes }

There are many changes between Ubuntu 14.04 and 20.04 that you should be aware of before migrating.
Many are changes that Canonical has made (the company behind Ubuntu), but also changes that CircleCI has made to the software that we pre-install.
Let's go through each of these changes separately.

### Changes to Ubuntu
{: #change-to-ubuntu }

- kernel - The Linux kernel was bumped from v4.4 to v5.11.

- OpenSSH - OpenSSH was updated to v8.2. This is a new enough version to not be affected by [GitHub's deprecation](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/).
