  Helpful information to aid in migrating from the CircleCI Ubuntu 16.04 images

## Switching to a supported image
{: #switching-to-a-supported-image }

Swapping out the deprecated image for a supported one in the CircleCI config is straightforward.
Additional work to get your pipelines to run with the newer image will depend on if the [changes below](#changes) apply to your project.
Here's an example config using an Ubuntu 16.04 image vs one using a 20.04 image:

{:.tab.linuxVM.Deprecated-Image}
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-1604:202007-01
    steps:
      run: echo "do something"
```

{:.tab.linuxVM.Supported-Image}
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2004:202201-02
    steps:
      run: echo "do something"
```

Supported images (and tags) can be found in the [Developer Hub](https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=machine).

**Note: This guide will be updated over time to include additional information and tips as CircleCI and customers share their experiences with this migration.**


## Changes
{: #changes }

There are many changes between Ubuntu 16.04 and 20.04 that you should be aware of before migrating.
Many are changes that Canonical has made (the company behind Ubuntu), but also changes that CircleCI has made to the software that we pre-install.
Let's go through each of these changes separately.

### Changes to Ubuntu
