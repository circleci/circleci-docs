The CircleCI [Jenkins Converter](https://circleci.com/developer/tools/jenkins-converter) is a web tool that allows you to easily convert a Jenkinsfile to a CircleCI config.yml, helping you to get started building on CircleCI quickly and easily.

Currently, the converter only supports declarative Jenkinsfiles. While the number of supported plug-ins and steps continue to be expanded, the hope is that this tool gets you started at least 50% of the way, and makes it easier for you to get started building on CircleCI.

## Limitations
{: #limitations }

* A limited number of syntaxes and plugins are supported. Jenkinsfiles relying on unsupported syntaxes and plugins cannot be converted. Please manually remove them.

* Only a single Jenkinsfile is accepted per request. Namely, [Shared Libraries](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) will not be resolved, and the resulting `config.yml` may be incomplete. Note that under certain cases the converter does not raise errors even if there are unresolvable Shared Libraries.

* Only `Default` is supported as a tool name for `maven`, `jdk` and `gradle` in the [`tools` block](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#tools), and other names will cause conversion failures. Please configure them as follows or remove them manually.

  For example, the following stanza:
  ```
  tools {
    maven 'Maven 3.6.3'
    jdk 'Corretto 8.232'
  }
  ```
  should be changed to:
  ```
  tools {
    maven 'Default'
    jdk 'Default'
  }
  ```

## Next steps after conversion
{: #next-steps-after-conversion }

### Executors
{: #executors }

A static Docker executor, [cimg/base](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base), is inserted as the [executor](https://circleci.com/docs/reference-2-1/#executors) regardless of the one defined within the Jenkinsfile input.

Given that `cimg/base` is a very lean image, it's highly likely that your project will require a different image. [CircleCI's convenience images](https://circleci.com/developer/images/) are a good place to find other images. Refer to [custom Docker image](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/custom-images/) for advanced steps to create your own custom image.

Depending on the use case, you might require the [machine executor](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-machine) if your application requires full access to OS resources and the job environment, or the [macOS executor](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-macos).

### Workflows
{: #workflows }

[CircleCI Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/) (the equivalent of Jenkins pipelines) are transferred from your Jenkinsfile to the config.yml, including branch filters. The converter will not transfer any [scheduled builds](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#triggers) to prevent unintentional builds from being triggered.

### Jobs
{: #jobs }

Many of the configuration options within CircleCI jobs don't have equivalents to Jenkins' offerings. It is best practice to start with the following features to get a richer experience from CircleCI:

- [Checkout code](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#checkout)
- [Resource class](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class)
- [Parallelism](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#parallelism)
- Caches, [saving](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#save_cache) and [restoring](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#restore_cache)
- [Store Artifacts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_artifacts)

### Steps
{: #steps }

While the Jenkinsfile Converter attempts to directly translate steps, it does not provide full translation of all steps. To address this, the `JFC_STACK_TRACE` key was added to translate specific steps within the output YAML and to provide some guidance on how to proceed with unsupported step directives.

## Supported syntax
{: #supported-syntax }

Only declarative (pipeline) `Jenkinsfile`s are currently supported.
