= Selecting a workflow to run using pipeline parameters
:page-layout: classic-docs

You might find that you want to manually trigger a specific workflow to run using the API but still run a workflow on every push to your project. To achieve this, use <<pipeline-variables#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration,pipeline parameters>> to decide which workflow(s) to run.

[#config]
== config.yml

The following example defaults to running the `build` workflow, but allows control of which other workflow to run using the API:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

parameters:
  action:
    type: enum
    enum: [build, report]
    default: build

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: ./run-tests.sh

  report:
    machine: true
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: ./create-report.sh

workflows:
  build:
    when:
      equal: [ build, << pipeline.parameters.action >> ]
    jobs:
      - build

  report:
    when:
      equal: [ report, << pipeline.parameters.action >> ]
    jobs:
      - report

[#supply-parameter-with-api]
== Supply parameter with API

The `action` parameter will default to `build` on pushes to the project. Below is an example of supplying a different value to `action` using the API v2 link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/triggerPipeline[Trigger a New Pipeline] endpoint to select a different workflow to run. 

In this example, the workflow named `report` would run. Remember to substitute <<api-developers-guide#getting-started-with-the-api,`project-slug`>> with your values.

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Circle-Token: API_KEY' \
  -d '{ "parameters": { "action": report } }'
