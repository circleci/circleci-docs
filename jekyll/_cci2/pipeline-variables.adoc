[#introduction]
== Introduction

Pipeline values and parameters can be used to create reusable pipeline configurations.

- *Pipeline values* represent pipeline metadata that can be used throughout the configuration.
- *Pipeline parameters* are typed pipeline variables that are declared in the `parameters` key at the top level of a configuration. Users can pass `parameters` into their pipelines when triggering a new run of a pipeline through the API or web app.

[#pipeline-values]
== Pipeline values

Pipeline values are available to all pipeline configurations and can be used without previous declaration.

For a full list of values and built-in environment variables, see the xref:variables#[Project values and variables] guide.

include::../_includes/partials/tips/check-github-type.adoc[Check your GitHub integration type]

include::../_includes/snippets/pipeline-values.adoc[]

Usage example:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:17.0
    environment:
      CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL: << pipeline.project.git_url >>/compare/<< pipeline.git.base_revision >>..<<pipeline.git.revision>>
    working_directory: ~/main
    steps:
      - run: echo "This is pipeline ID << pipeline.id >>"
      - run: echo $CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL
```

When using the above method to set the values in the `environment` key, note that if the pipeline variable is empty it will be set to `<nil>`. If you need an empty string instead, xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-shell-command[set the variable in a shell command].

[#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration]
== Pipeline parameters

Pipeline parameters are declared using the `parameters` key at the top level of a `.circleci/config.yml` file. Pipeline parameters can be referenced by value and used as a configuration variable under the scope `pipeline.parameters`.

Pipeline parameters support the following types:

- `string`
- `boolean`
- `integer`
- `enum`

See xref:reusing-config#parameter-syntax[Parameter syntax] for usage details.

The example below shows a configuration with two pipeline parameters (`image-tag` and `workingdir`) defined at the top of the configuration, and then subsequently referenced in the `build` job:

```yml
version: 2.1

parameters:
  image-tag:
    type: string
    default: "current"
  workingdir:
    type: string
    default: "~/main"

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:<< pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>
    environment:
      IMAGETAG: << pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>
    working_directory: << pipeline.parameters.workingdir >>
    steps:
      - run: echo "Image tag used was ${IMAGETAG}"
      - run: echo "$(pwd) == << pipeline.parameters.workingdir >>"
```

[#passing-parameters-when-triggering-pipelines-via-the-api]
=== Passing parameters when triggering pipelines via the API

A pipeline can be triggered with specific `parameter` values using the API v2 endpoint to link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#trigger-a-new-pipeline[trigger a pipeline]. This can be done by passing a `parameters` key in the JSON packet of the `POST` body.

The API limits the number of parameters that can be passed:

* 100 max entries
* 128 maximum key length
* 512 maximum value length

The `parameters` key passed in this `POST` request is *NOT* secret.

The example below triggers a pipeline with the parameters described in the above configuration example. If you run a command to trigger a pipeline, and the parameter has not been declared in the configuration file, you will receive an error response message, such as `Project not found`.

CAUTION: If your project code is integrated with CircleCI via the GitHub App, GitLab or Bitbucket Data Center, you will need to use the new link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#tag/Pipeline/operation/triggerPipelineRun[Trigger a new pipeline endpoint] rather than the endpoint used in this example.

```shell
curl -u ${CIRCLE_TOKEN}: -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "parameters": {
    "workingdir": "./myspecialdir",
    "image-tag": "4.8.2"
  }
}' https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project_slug}/pipeline
```

include::../_includes/partials/tips/find-project-slug.adoc[]

Refer to the xref:api-developers-guide#getting-started-with-the-api[Getting started with the API] section of the API Developer's Guide for more guidance on making requests.

[#passing-parameters-when-triggering-pipelines-using-the-circleci-web-app]
=== Passing parameters when triggering pipelines using the CircleCI web app

In addition to using the API, you can also trigger a pipeline with parameters from the CircleCI web app. If you pass a parameter when triggering a pipeline from the web app, and the parameter has not been declared in the configuration file, the pipeline will fail with the error `Unexpected argument(s)`.

. Use the project filter to select the desired project.
. Use the branch filter to select the branch on which you want to run the new pipeline.
. Select *Trigger Pipeline* (towards the top right corner of the page).
. Use the *Add Parameters* dropdown to specify the type, name, and value of your desired parameters.
. Select *Trigger Pipeline*.

Parameters can also be called when setting up a scheduled pipeline in the web app. The parameters are part of the trigger form in menu:Project Settings[Triggers]. Any parameter set up as a part of a scheduled pipeline will also need to be declared in the configuration file, otherwise the pipeline will fail with the error `Unexpected argument(s)`.

[#configuration-processing-stages]
== Configuration processing stages

Configuration processing happens in the following stages:

- Pipeline parameters are resolved and type-checked
- Pipeline parameters are replaced in the orb statement
- Orbs are imported

The remaining configuration is processed, element parameters are resolved, type-checked, and substituted.

[#the-scope-of-parameters-in-configuration]
== The scope of parameters in configuration

Pipeline parameters can only be resolved in the `.circleci/config.yml` file in which they are declared. Pipeline parameters are not available in orbs, including orbs declared locally in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. This is because access to pipeline scope in orbs would break encapsulation and create a hard dependency between the orb and the calling configuration. This would potentially create a surface area of vulnerability, increasing security risks.

[#element-parameter-scope]
=== Element parameter scope

Element parameters, which are parameters set in a job, a command, or an executor, use lexical scoping. That is, element parameters are in scope within the element they are defined in. If an element with parameters calls another element with parameters, like in the example below, the inner element does not inherit the scope of the calling element.

```yaml
version: 2.1

commands:
  print:
    parameters:
      message:
        type: string
    steps:
      - run: echo << parameters.message >>

jobs:
  daily-message:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2004:current
    resource_class: large
    parameters:
      message:
        type: string
    steps:
      - print:
          message: Printing << parameters.message >>

workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - daily-message:
         message: echo << parameters.message >>
```

Even though the `print` command is called from the `cat-file` job, the file parameter would not be in scope inside the print job. This ensures that all parameters are always bound to a valid value, and the set of available parameters is always known. Running this would throw a pipeline error of `Arguments referenced without declared parameters: message`.

[#pipeline-value-scope]
=== Pipeline value scope

Pipeline values, the pipeline-wide values that are provided by CircleCI (for example, `<< pipeline.number >>`) are always in scope.

[#pipeline-parameter-scope]
=== Pipeline parameter scope

Pipeline parameters which are defined in configuration are always in scope, with two exceptions:

- Pipeline parameters are not in scope for the definition of other pipeline parameters, so they cannot depend on one another.
- Pipeline parameters are not in scope in the body of orbs, even inline orbs, to prevent data leaks.

[#pipeline-parameters-and-dynamic-configuration]
=== Pipeline parameters and dynamic configuration

When using setup workflows to pass control of the pipeline to a second configuration, all pipeline parameters that are declared in the setup workflow must also be declared, with the same defaults, in the second configuration.

When the setup workflow passes control to a second configuration, the parameters passed _to_ the setup workflow will be merged in with any parameters specified _in_ the setup workflow, before being passed to the second configuration. When using dynamic configuration, the second configuration must tolerate receiving any parameters that the setup workflow's code passes, as well as any parameters that the setup workflow _could_ accept.

If there are name conflicts between pipeline parameters specified in a setup workflow and those specified in an API request when triggering a pipeline, the continuation process will fail, and the pipeline will error.

More information on setup workflows can be found in the xref:dynamic-config#how-dynamic-config-works[How dynamic config works] section of the Dynamic Configuration overview.

[#conditional-workflows]
== Pipeline parameters and conditional workflows

Use the xref:configuration-reference#using-when-in-workflows[`when` clause] (or the inverse clause `unless`) under a workflow declaration, along with a xref:configuration-reference#logic-statements[logic statement], to decide whether or not to run that workflow. Logic statements in a `when` or `unless` clause should evaluate to a truthy or falsy value.

The most common use of this construct is to use a pipeline parameter as the value, allowing a trigger to pass that parameter to determine which workflows to run. Below is an example configuration using the pipeline parameter `run_integration_tests` to set whether the workflow `integration_tests` will run.

```yaml
version: 2.1

parameters:
  run_integration_tests:
    type: boolean
    default: false

workflows:
  integration_tests:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run_integration_tests >>
    jobs:
      - mytestjob

jobs:
  mytestjob:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - ... # job steps
```

In this example, the workflow `integration_tests` is not triggered unless it is explicitly invoked when the pipeline is triggered with the following in the `POST` body:

```json
{
    "parameters": {
        "run_integration_tests": true
    }
}
```

The `when` key accepts any truthy or falsy value, not just pipeline parameters, though pipeline parameters will be the primary use of this feature until more are implemented. `when` also has an inverse clause `unless`, which inverts truthiness of the condition.
