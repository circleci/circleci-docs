NOTE: Now in **open preview**: A more scalable, container-friendly self-hosted runner called <<container-runner#,container runner>>. Read more on link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/a-more-scalable-container-friendly-self-hosted-runner-container-agent-now-in-open-preview/45094[CircleCI Discuss].

[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI's self-hosted runner enables you to use your own infrastructure for running jobs. This means you will be able to build and test on a wider variety of architectures, as well as have additional control over the environment. 

You have the option of installing your self-hosted runner in a Kubernetes clusters using a container runner or within a machine execution environment using a machine runner. The diagrams below illustrate how CircleCI's container runner and machine runner extend our existing systems.

[#circleci-runner-use-cases]
== CircleCI runner use cases

There are two key use cases CircleCI aims to meet with self-hosted runners:

* Privileged access and controls - CircleCI understands that some customers require running jobs on on-premises or limited-access infrastructure due to stricter isolation requirements. Some things the self-hosted runner enables are:
** IP restrictions - Self-hosted runners can have static IP addresses that you can control
** Identity Access Management (IAM) permissions - If you set up self-hosted runners in AWS, they can be assigned IAM permissions
** Monitor the operating system
** Connect to private networks

* Unique compute requirements - Customers who need to run jobs on an environment or architecture that CircleCI does not offer as a resource class can use the self-hosted runner to fill that need.

[#choosing-a-runner-execution-environment]
== Choosing a runner execution environment

CircleCI offers multiple execution environments for self-hosted runners: container and machine.

[#container-runner-use-case]
=== Container runner

Container runner is installed in a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster which enables you to run containerized jobs on self-hosted compute, similar to how jobs use the native Docker executor to run on CircleCI’s cloud platform. This solution allows you to run hundreds of jobs at once, scaling pods effectively to meet compute demands.

Container runner allows you to use CircleCI's <<circleci-images#,convenience images>> as well as custom Docker images.

[#machine-runner-use-case]
=== Machine runner

Machine runner is installed either in a virtual machine or natively on a physical machine.  Each machine runner job executes in the same environment (virtual or physical) as where the self-hosted runner binary is installed. CircleCI's machine runner can be installed on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Machine runner should be used if you are not running containerized CI jobs, see <<docker-to-machine,machine execution environment>> docs for more examples on when to use a machine execution environment.

If you do not use Kubernetes but still want to run your CI job in a container on a self-hosted runner, you can install the machine runner in Docker.

Machine runner is not compatible with CircleCI's convienience images or custom Docker images.

[#getting-started]
== Getting started

To get started with CircleCI's self-hosted runners:

* Provide your own platform to deploy your CircleCI's self-hosted runners (see the <<#available-self-hosted-runner-platforms,Available self-hosted runner platforms>> section for supported platforms)
* For container runner installation, visit the <<container-runner#, Container runner>> page.
* For machine runner, installation vistit the xref:runner-installation.adoc[Web app installation] page.

[#circleci-self-hosted-runner-operation]
== CircleCI's self-hosted runner operation

Once a CircleCI's self-hosted runner is installed, the self-hosted runner polls `circleci.com` for work, runs jobs, and returns status, logs, and artifacts to CircleCI. 

[#available-self-hosted-runner-platforms]
== Available self-hosted runner platforms

*Supported* level platforms ensure that CircleCI's self-hosted runners are both built and tested on their respective systems.

With a supported platform, users receive the following:

* Documentation and best practices
* Support: CircleCI customer engineers will assist customers to resolve issues within their usual Advanced Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

*Supported* CircleCI's self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

**Container and machine self-hosted runners:**

* Ubuntu 18.04 or later (x86_64, ARM64)

**Container runners:**

* Kubernetes (x86_64, ARM64)

**Machine runners:**

* RHEL8 (x86_64, ARM64)
* macOS X 10.15+ (Intel)
* macOS X 11.2+ (Apple M1)
* Windows Server 2019, 2016 (x86_64)
* Linux distributions - SUSE, Debian, etc (x86_64, ARM64)

CircleCI sometimes offers a **preview** level platform when a new platform for self-hosted runner is in active development. If there is a platform in a preview level, this section will be updated with information and limitations for that platform.

[#limitations]
== Limitations

Almost all standard CircleCI features are available for use with self-hosted runner jobs, however, a few features are not yet supported.

* The following built-in environment variables are not populated within runner executors:
  ** `CIRCLE_PREVIOUS_BUILD_NUM`
  ** All deprecated cloud environment variables
* Docker layer caching

* For limitations relating to container runner, visit the <<container-runner#limitations, Container runner>> page.
