This page provides an overview of CircleCI jobs and steps.

[#jobs-overview]
== Jobs overview

A CircleCI job is a collection of steps. All of the steps in the job are executed in a single unit, either within a fresh container, or a virtual machine. Jobs are orchestrated using xref:workflows#[workflows].

The following diagram illustrates how data flows between jobs:

* Workspaces persist data between jobs in a single workflow.
* Caching persists data between the same job in different workflows runs.
* Artifacts persist data after a workflow has finished.

Jobs can be run in Docker containers, using the Docker executor, or in virtual machines using the `machine` executor, with Linux, macOS, or Windows images. Secondary containers or VMs can be configured to attach services, such as databases, to run alongside your jobs.

When using the Docker executor, images listed under the `docker` key specify the containers you want to start for your job. Any public Docker images can be used with the Docker executor, but CircleCI provides convenience images for a variety of use-cases. Full lists of available convenience and VM images are available in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images[CircleCI Developer Hub].

See the xref:executor-intro#[Introduction to Execution Environments] document for a comparison of the different executor types, and links to further information for each option.

=== Job naming

When you configure a job you will give it a name. This is its job property name:

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  my-job: # the job property name
----

The job property name can be anything you like with the following restrictions:

* Must be unique within the jobs stanza.
* Only ASCII alphabet characters, underscores, and dashes.
* No spaces.

When you configure a job in a workflow you have the option to give it an xref:configuration-reference#name[alternative name]. This alternative name can be useful if you want to call a job more than once in a workflow.

[,yml]
----
workflows:
  jobs:
    my-job: # the job property name
      name: My Job # the alternative job name within the workflow
----

The job name within the workflow can be anything you like _including_ spaces and special characters.

[#steps-overview]
== Steps overview

Steps are collections of executable commands, which are run during a job.

The `checkout` key is required under `steps` to checkout your code. The `run` key enables addition of arbitrary, multi-line shell command scripting.

In addition to the `run` key, keys for `save_cache`, `restore_cache`, `store_artifacts`, `store_test_results`, and `add_ssh_keys` are nested under steps. For a full list of step options see the xref:configuration-reference#steps[Steps key] section of the Configuration Reference.

[#passing-parameters-to-jobs]
== Passing parameters to jobs

Using parameters allows you to run a single job multiple times for different scenarios, such as different package versions or execution environments. An extension of this functionality is xref:configuration-reference#matrix[matrix jobs]. Below is a basic example of passing a parameter to a job when it is run.

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1
​
jobs:
  print-a-message:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2022.03
    parameters:
      message:
        type: string
    steps:
      - run: echo << parameters.message >>
​
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - print-a-message:
          message: Hello!

[#using-a-job-from-an-orb]
== Using a job from an orb

Orbs are packages or reusable configuration that you can use in your projects. Orbs usually contain commands that you can use in your jobs, as well as whole jobs that you can schedule in your workflows.

Take the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack[Slack orb] as an example. This orb provides a job called link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack#usage-on_hold_notification[`on-hold`], which you can use in your workflows. This job pauses the workflow to require manual approval, and sends a slack notification. To use this job, reference it in your workflow (see line 10):

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@4.1

workflows:
  on-hold-example:
    jobs:
      - my_test_job
      - slack/on-hold:
          context: slack-secrets
          requires:
            - my_test_job
      - pause_workflow:
          requires:
            - my_test_job
            - slack/on-hold
          type: approval
      - my_deploy_job:
          requires:
            - pause_workflow

[#using-a-command-from-an-orb-in-a-job]
== Using a command from an orb in a job

Using the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack[Slack orb] as an example again, this orb includes a command called `notify`, which is used to notify a specified slack channel. You can reference this command in your job as follows (see line 16):

This example also uses the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node[Node orb].

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  node: 'circleci/node:4.1'
  slack: circleci/slack@4.1

jobs:
  deploy:
    executor:
      name: node/default
    steps:
      - checkout
      - node/install-packages
      - run:
          command: npm run deploy
      - slack/notify:
          channel: ABCXYZ
          event: fail
          template: basic_fail_1

workflows:
  deploy_and_notify:
    jobs:
      - deploy:
          context: slack-secrets
