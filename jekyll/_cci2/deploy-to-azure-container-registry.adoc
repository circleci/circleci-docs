In this how-to guide, you will learn how to to configure CircleCI to deploy to Azure Container Registry.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

This page describes a simple deployment to the Azure Container Registry (ACR) using the CircleCI ACR orb and `version 2.1` configuration.

{% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

In addition to the orb described below, CircleCI has created an Azure convenience image focusing on deployment, link:https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/azure[cimg/azure].


For detailed information about the Azure ACR orb, including all options, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/azure-acr[CircleCI ACR Orb Reference] page.

[#provide-env-vars]
== 1. Provide environment variables to CircleCI

Whether your require a user or service principal login, you will need to provide environment variables for username, password and tenant to CircleCI. For user logins use env var names as follows: `AZURE_USERNAME`, `AZURE_PASSWORD` and `AZURE_TENANT`. For service principal logins use: `AZURE_SP`, `AZURE_SP_PASSWORD` and `AZURE_SP_TENANT`.

[#deploy-to-acr]
== 2. Deploy to ACR

Use the orb's `build-and-push-image` job to build your image and deploy it to ACR. Note the use of workflows to deploy only if the current branch is `main`.

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1 # Use version 2.1 config to get access to orbs, pipelines

orbs:
    azure-acr: circleci/azure-acr@x.y.z # Use the Azure ACR orb in your config

workflows:
    build-deploy:
    jobs:
        - azure/build-and-push-image:
            dockerfile: <name-of-your-dockerfile> # defaults to `Dockerfile`
            path: <path-to-your-dockerfile> # Defaults to working directory
            login-server-name: <your-login-server-name> # e.g. {yourregistryname}.azure.io
            registry-name: <your-ACR-registry-name>
            repo: <URI-to-your-login-server-name>
            filters:
            branches:
                only: main # Only deploys when the commit is on the Main branch
```

If pushing to your repository is required, see the "Deployment Keys" section of the xref:github-integration#user-keys-and-deploy-keys[GitHub] or xref:bitbucket-integration#deploy-keys-and-user-keys[Bitbucket] instructions. Then, configure the Azure Web App to use your production branch.
