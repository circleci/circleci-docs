It is assumed you have already read the Server 3.x https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-overview[overview].

In order to configure the CircleCI Server application, you will need to ensure the following general and infrastructure-specific requirements are met. You will need:

* An existing Kubernetes cluster (see xref:server-3-install-creating-your-first-cluster.adoc[our guide] if you need help creating one), for example:
** Creating an Amazon EKS cluster - https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/[Amazon EKS]
*** Using `eksctl` is our recommended option, as it creates a VPC and selects the proper security group for you.
** Creating clusters - https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to#creating-clusters[Google GKE] +
*** Do NOT use an Autopilot cluster. CircleCI requires functionality that is not supported by GKE Autopilot.
+
* Note your Kubernetes cluster must meet the following minimum overall cluster requirements relative to the number of active
CircleCI Server users: +

* Your cluster must have outbound access to pull Docker containers and verify your license. If you do not want to provide open outbound access, see our https://help.replicated.com/community/t/customer-firewalls/55[list of ports] that will need access.
* You must have appropriate permissions to list, create, edit and delete pods in your cluster. You can verify that you can list these resources by running: `kubectl auth can-i <list|create|edit|delete> pods`.
* A CircleCI License file. Contact https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[CircleCI support] for a license.
* The <<Required Tools>> tools installed
** Note that the `kubectl` tool must also be configured to have access to your cluster.

NOTE: There are no requirements regarding VPC setup or disk size for your cluster. It is, however, recommended that you
set up a new VPC rather than use an existing one.
