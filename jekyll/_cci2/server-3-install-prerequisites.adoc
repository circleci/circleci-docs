// This doc uses ifdef and ifndef directives to display or hide content specific to Google Cloud Storage (env-gcp) and AWS (env-aws). Currently, this affects only the generated PDFs. To ensure compatability with the Jekyll version, the directives test for logical opposites. For example, if the attribute is NOT env-aws, display this content. For more information, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/.

== Phase 1: Prerequisites
Install CircleCI server in 4 phases. There is a validation step at the end of each phase, allowing you to confirm success before moving to the next phase. Depending on your requirements, phases 3 and 4 may include multiple steps. This installation guide assumes you have already read the server 3.x https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-overview[overview].

NOTE: In the following sections, replace any items or credentials displayed between `< >` with your details.

| 3.4.0
| 1.16 - 1.22
|===

Creating a Kubernetes cluster is your responsibility. Please note:

* Your cluster must have outbound access to pull Docker containers and verify your license. If you do not want to provide open outbound access, see our https://help.replicated.com/community/t/customer-firewalls/55[list of ports] that will need access.
* You must have appropriate permissions to list, create, edit, and delete pods in your cluster. Run this command to verify your permissions:
+
```shell
kubectl auth can-i <list|create|edit|delete> pods
```
* There are no requirements regarding VPC setup or disk size for your cluster. It is recommended that you
set up a new VPC rather than use an existing one.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

==== EKS
You can learn more about creating an Amazon EKS cluster https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/[here]. We recommend using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html[`eksctl`] to create your cluster, which will create a VPC and select the proper security groups for you.

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html[Install] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configure] the AWS CLI for your AWS account.
. Install https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html[`eksctrl`].
. Create your cluster by running the following (Cloud formation with `eksctl` and EKS can take more than 20 minutes to complete):
+
```shell
eksctl create cluster --name=circleci-server --nodes 4 --node-type m5.xlarge
```
. Once the cluster has been created, you can use the following command to configure `kubectl` access:
+
```shell
eksctl utils write-kubeconfig --name circleci-server
```

NOTE: You may see the following error `AWS STS Access - cannot get role ARN for current session: InvalidClientTokenID`. This means your AWS credentials are invalid, or your IAM user does not have permission to create an EKS cluster. Proper IAM permissions are necessary in order to use `eksctl`. See the AWS documentation regarding https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-permissions/[IAM permissions].

endif::env-gcp[]

ifndef::env-aws[]

==== GKE
You can learn more about creating a GKE cluster https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to#creating-clusters[here].

CAUTION: Do not use Autopilot cluster. CircleCI requires functionality that is not supported by GKE Autopilot.

. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud[Install] and https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#defaults[configure] the GCP CLI for your GCP account. This includes creating a Google Project, which will be required to create a cluster within your project. When you create your project, make sure you also enabled API access. If you do not enable API access, the command we will run next (to create your cluster) will fail.
. Create your cluster by entering running the following command:
+
```shell
gcloud container clusters create circleci-server --project <YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID> --region europe-west1 --num-nodes 3 --machine-type n1-standard-4
```
. Configure` kubectl` with your your credentials gcloud credentials:
+
```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials circleci-server --region europe-west1
```
. Verify your cluster:
+
```shell
kubectl cluster-info
```
. Create a service account for this cluster:
+
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID> --description="<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME>"  --display-name="<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME>"
```
. Get the credentials for the service account:
+
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create <PATH_TO_STORE_CREDENTIALS> --iam-account <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
endif::env-aws[]

===== Enabling Workload Identity in GKE
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Workload identities] for GKE allow workloads/pods in your GKE cluster to impersonate IAM service accounts to access Google Cloud services without using static service account credentials. You have to enable workload identities on your GKE cluster to use it. 

====== Step 1: Enable Workload Identity on existing cluster
```shell
  gcloud container clusters update "<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
    --region="<REGION>" \
    --workload-pool="<PROJECT_ID>.svc.id.goog"
```

====== Step 2: Updating existing node pools
```shell
  gcloud container node-pools update "<NODEPOOL_NAME>" \
    --cluster="<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
    --workload-metadata="GKE_METADATA" \
    --region="<REGION>"
```
    You have to repeat the above command for all the existing node pools.


=== Create a new GitHub OAuth app

CAUTION: If GitHub Enterprise and CircleCI server are not on the same domain then images will fail to load.

Registering and setting up a new GitHub OAuth app for CircleCI server allows for authorization control to your server installation using GitHub OAuth and for updates to GitHub projects/repos using build status information.

. In your browser, navigate to **your GitHub instance** > **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **OAuth Apps** and click the **New OAuth App** button.
+
.New GitHub OAuth App
image::github-oauth-new.png[Screenshot showing setting up a new OAuth app]

. Complete the following fields based on your planned installation:
** *Homepage URL*: The URL of your planned CircleCI installation.
** *Authorization callback URL*: The authorization callback URL will be the URL of your planned CircleCI installation followed by `/auth/github`

. Once completed, you will be shown the *Client ID*. Select *Generate a new Client Secret* to generate a Client Secret for your new OAuth App. You will need these values when you configure CircleCI server.
+
.Client ID and Secret
image::github-clientid.png[Screenshot showing GitHub Client ID]

NOTE: If using GitHub Enterprise, you will also need a personal access token and the domain name of your GitHub Enterprise instance.

=== Frontend TLS certificates
By default, CircleCI server will create self-signed certificates to get you started. In production, you should supply a certificate from a trusted certificate authority. The link:https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] certificate authority, for example, can issue a free certificate using their link:https://certbot.eff.org/[certbot] tool. In the sections below we cover using Google Cloud DNS and AWS Route53.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

==== AWS Route53

. If you are using AWS Route53 for DNS, you will need the *certbot-route53* plugin installed. You can install the plugin with the following command:
+
```shell
pip3 install certbot-dns-route53
```

. Then execute this example to create a private key and certificate (including intermediate certificates) locally in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>`:
+
```shell
certbot certonly --dns-route53 -d "<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>" -d "app.<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>"
```

You will need these certificates later, and they can be retrieved locally with the following commands:

```shell
ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>
```

```shell
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem
```

```shell
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem
```

NOTE: It is important that your certificate contains both your domain and the app.* subdomain as subjects. For example, if you host your installation at server.example.com, your certificate must cover app.server.example.com and server.example.com

endif::env-gcp[]

ifndef::env-aws[]

==== Google Cloud DNS

. If you host your DNS on Google Cloud, you will need the *certbot-dns-google* plugin installed. You can install the plugin with the following command:
+
```shell
pip3 install certbot-dns-google
```

. Then, the following commands will provision a certification for your installation:
+
```shell
certbot certonly --dns-google --dns-google-credentials <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS> -d "<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>" -d "app.<CIRCLECI_SERVER_DOMAIN>"
```

NOTE: It is important that your certificate contains both your domain and the app.* subdomain as subjects. For example, if you host your installation at server.example.com, your certificate must cover app.server.example.com and server.example.com

endif::env-aws[]

=== Encryption/signing keys
These keysets are used to encrypt and sign artifacts generated by CircleCI. You will need these values to configure server.

CAUTION: Store these values securely. If they are lost, job history and artifacts will not be recoverable.

==== Artifact signing key
To generate, run the following command:

```shell
docker run circleci/server-keysets:latest generate signing -a stdout
```

==== Encryption signing key
To generate, run the following command:

```shell
docker run circleci/server-keysets:latest generate encryption -a stdout
```

=== Object storage and permissions
Server 3.x hosts build artifacts, test results, and other state object storage. We support the following:

* link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[AWS S3]

* link:https://min.io/[Minio]

* link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage]

While any S3 compatible object storage may work, we test and support AWS S3 and Minio. For object storage providers that do not support S3 API, such as Azure blob storage, we recommend using Minio Gateway.

Please choose the option that best suits your needs. A Storage Bucket Name is required, in addition to the fields listed below, depending on whether you are using AWS or GCP. Ensure the bucket name you provide exists in your chosen object storage provider before proceeding.

NOTE: If you are installing behind a proxy, object storage should be behind this proxy also. Otherwise proxy details will need to be supplied at the job level within every project `.circleci/config.yml` to allow artifacts, test results, cache save and restore, and workspaces to work. For more information see the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-3-operator-proxy/[Configuring a Proxy] guide.

ifndef::env-gcp[]

==== Create an S3 storage bucket
You will need the following details when you configure CircleCI server.

* *Storage Bucket Name* - The bucket name to be used for server.

* *Access Key ID* - Access Key ID for S3 bucket access.

* *Secret Key* - Secret Key for S3 bucket access.

* *AWS S3 Region* - AWS region of bucket if your provider is AWS. You will either have an AWS region or S3 Endpoint depending on your specific setup.

* *S3 Endpoint* - API endpoint of S3 storage provider, when your storage provider is not Amazon S3.

===== Step 1: Create AWS S3 Bucket

```shell
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME> \
    --region <YOUR_REGION> \
    --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<YOUR_REGION>
```

NOTE: `us-east-1` does not support a LocationConstraint. If your region is `us-east-1`, omit the bucket configuration

===== Step 2: Create an IAM user for CircleCI server

```shell
aws iam create-user --user-name circleci-server
```

===== Step 3: Create a policy document _policy.json_

If using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for authentication, use the following content

==== Create a Google Cloud storage bucket
You will need the following details when you configure CircleCI server.

* *Storage Bucket Name* - The bucket used for server.

* *Service Account JSON* - A JSON format key of the Service Account to use for bucket access.

A dedicated service account is recommended. Add to it the Storage Object Admin role, with a condition on the resource name limiting access to only the bucket specified above. For example, enter the following into the Google’s Condition Editor in the IAM console:

NOTE: Use `startsWith` and prefix the bucket name with `projects/_/buckets/`.

```shell
resource.name.startsWith("projects/_/buckets/<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>")
```

===== Step 1: Create a GCP bucket
If your server installation runs within a GKE cluster, ensure that your current IAM user is a cluster admin for this cluster, as RBAC (role-based access control) objects need to be created. More information can be found in the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control[GKE documentation].

```shell
gsutil mb gs://circleci-server-bucket
```

===== Step 2: Create a Service Account

```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create circleci-server --display-name "circleci-server service account"
```

You will need the email for the service account in the next step. Run the following command to find it:

```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts list \
  --filter="displayName:circleci-server account" \
  --format 'value(email)'
```

===== Step 3: Grant Permissions to Service Account

```shell
gcloud iam roles create circleci_server \
    --project <PROJECT_ID> \
    --title "CircleCI Server" \
    --permissions \ compute.disks.get,compute.disks.create,compute.disks.createSnapshot,compute.snapshots.get,compute.snapshots.create,compute.snapshots.useReadOnly,compute.snapshots.delete,compute.zones.get
```

```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
    --member serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> \
    --role projects/<PROJECT_ID>/roles/circleci_server
```

```shell
gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>:objectAdmin gs://circleci-server-bucket
