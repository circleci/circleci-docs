CircleCI 2.0 may be installed, without a support package, on AWS using the examples and instructions in this document. Alternatively, if you do decide to go ahead with a support package, there are a number of benefits, as detailed below.

=== Non-AWS Platform Support

With a Platinum CircleCI support package it is possible to install and configure CircleCI on Azure or any other platform used in your organization. Contact https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[CircleCI support] or your account representative to get started.

=== Externalization

With a Platinum support agreement, it is possible to improve performance by configuring the following services to run externally to the Services machine:

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Vault
- Rabbitmq
- Redis
- Nomad

Contact https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[CircleCI support] or your account representative to evaluate your installation against the current requirements for running external services.
