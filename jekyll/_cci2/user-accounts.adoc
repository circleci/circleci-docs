. Select Users from the Admin Settings menu
. Scroll to locate the account in either the Active or Inactive window
. Click `Suspend` next to the account name and the account will appear in the Suspended window

== Controlling Account Access

Any user associated with your GitHub.com or Github Enterprise organization can create a user account for your CircleCI installation. In order to control who has access, you can automatically suspend **all** new users, requiring an administrator to activate them before they can log in. To access this feature:

1. Navigate to your CircleCI Admin Settings
2. Select System Settings from the Admin Settings menu
3. Set Suspend New Users to `True`

=== Limit User Registrations by Github Organization

When using Github.com, you can limit who can register with your CircleCI install to people with *some* connection to your approved organizations list. To access this feature:

1. Navigate to your CircleCI Admin Settings page
2. Select System Settings from the Admin Setting menu
3. Scroll down to Required Org Membership List
4. Enter the organization(s) you wish to approve. If entering more than one organization, use a comma delimited string

NOTE: Any form of organization membership is within the scope of this approval feature, and it does not stop users from running builds associated with other organizations they may belong to.

=== Full User List

To view a full list of users for your CircleCI Server installation, first SSH into your Services machine, and then run:

```
circleci dev-console
(circle.model.user/where { :$and [{:sign_in_count {:$gte 0}}, {:login {:$ne nil}}]} :only [:login])
```

=== Deleting a User

If you need to remove a user from your installation of CircleCI Server, you will need to SSH into the services machine first and then delete using the following command, substituting the user's github username:

```shell
circleci dev-console
(circle.http.api.admin-commands.user/delete-by-login-vcs-type! "github-username-of-user" :github)
```
