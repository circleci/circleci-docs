This page provides a collection of examples to help you learn how to build, test, and deploy applications written in the most common programming languages, frameworks, and platforms on CircleCI.

If you are new to CircleCI, we recommend going through our <<getting-started#,Quickstart Guide>> for getting your first successful pipeline.

For basic examples of adding pipeline jobs in a specific execution environment such as a Docker container or Linux VM, review our <<hello-world#,Hello World>> document.

[#languages]
== Language guides

To get a project up and running on CircleCI, see the following quickstart guides:

* xref:language-javascript#[Configure a Node.js application on CircleCI]
* xref:language-python#[Configure a Python application on CircleCI]
* xref:language-go#[Configure a Go application on CircleCI]

We have created demo applications in various languages so you can learn by example. Each language listed below has an associated guide and public repository on GitHub.

[#platforms]
== Platform guides

Use the tutorial associated with your platform to learn about the customization that is possible in a <<configuration-reference#,`.circleci/config.yml`>>.
