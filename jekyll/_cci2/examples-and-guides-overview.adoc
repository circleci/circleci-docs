This page provides a collection of examples to help you learn how to build, test, and deploy applications written in the most common programming languages, frameworks, and platforms on CircleCI.

If you are new to CircleCI, we recommend going through our <<getting-started#,Quickstart Guide>> for getting your first successful pipeline.

For basic examples of adding pipeline jobs in a specific execution environment such as a Docker container or Linux VM, review our <<hello-world#,Hello World>> document.
