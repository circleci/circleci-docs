## Overview
{: #overview }

The CircleCI Insights dashboard provides an overview of the health and usage of
your projects' build processes, including time-series and aggregated data on credit usage,
success rates, and pipeline duration.

This document describes how to access and use the Insights dashboard on CircleCI cloud and server.

## Usage
{: #usage }

Insights across your organization can be accessed from the sidebar of the
CircleCI web application.

To access a specific project's Insights, view a pipeline's workflow and click
 the **Insights** button. Alternatively, you may access the Insights page by
 opening a pipeline's **Actions** menu while viewing the pipelines dashboard.

### Workflow overview
{: #workflow-overview }

The Insights workflow overview provides metrics plotted over time for all branches, or a select branch, of a particular project workflow. The following data is charted under the workflow overview:

- Status (success versus failed) of up to 100 most recent workflow runs
- Workflow success rate
- Workflow duration (50th versus 95th percentile)
- Workflow credit usage

Data is not real-time and there may be up to a 24 hour delay.

The Insights dashboard is not a real time financial reporting tool and should
not be used for credit reporting. The most up-to-date credit information can be
found in your organization's Plan Overview.

### Job overview
{: #job-overview }

Click the **Jobs** tab next to **Overview** to view the following cumulative data on a per-job basis:

- Total credits used
- Duration (95th percentile)
- Total runs
- Success rate
- Compute usage (average and max for CPU and RAM)

### Overview
{: #overview }

Click the Insights menu item in the CircleCI app to view a dashboard showing the health of all repositories you are following. Median build time, median queue time, last build time, success rate, and parallelism appear for your default branch. Note that if you have configured Workflows, graphs display all of the jobs that are being executed for your default branch.

The image illustrates the following data about your builds:

- Status of all your repos building on CircleCI in real time
- Median queue time
- Median build time
- Number of branches
- Last build

### Project insights
{: #project-insights }

Click the Insights icon on the main navigation, then click your repo name to access per-project insights.

The per-project insights page gives you access to the build status and build performance graphs for a selected branch.

- **Build Status:** The Insights dashboard shows the last 50 builds for your default branch. Click a branch in the top right corner to access over 100 build/job statuses for the selected branch.

- **Build Performance:** The Build Performance graph aggregates your build/job data for a particular day and plots the median for that day going back as far as 90 days. Monitor the performance of your repo by clicking a particular branch.
