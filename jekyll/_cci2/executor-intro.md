CircleCI offers several execution environments. We call these **executors**. An **executor** defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. Set up your jobs to run in the `docker`, `machine`, `macos` or  `windows` executor and specify an image with the tools and packages you need.

## Docker
{: #docker }

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <strong>Legacy images with the prefix "circleci/" were <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/legacy-convenience-image-deprecation/41034">deprecated</a></strong> on December 31, 2021. For faster builds, upgrade your projects with <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/announcing-our-next-generation-convenience-images-smaller-faster-more-deterministic/">next-generation convenience images</a>.

```yml
jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    docker: # executor type
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty # primary container will run Ubuntu Trusty

      steps:
        # Commands run in the primary container
```

## Machine
{: #machine }

Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 machine images [are deprecated and will be removed permanently May 31, 2022](https://circleci.com/blog/ubuntu-14-16-image-deprecation/). These images will be temporarily unavailable March 29 and April 26, 2022. Migrate from [14.04]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/images/linux-vm/14.04-to-20.04-migration/) or [16.04]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/images/linux-vm/16.04-to-20.04-migration/).

{:.tab.machine.Cloud}
```yml
jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    machine: # executor type
      image: ubuntu-2004:202010-01 # # recommended linux image - includes Ubuntu 20.04, docker 19.03.13, docker-compose 1.27.4

      steps:
        # Commands run in a Linux virtual machine environment
```

{:.tab.machine.Server_3}
```yml

    steps:
      # Commands run in a Linux virtual machine environment
```

{:.tab.machine.Server_2}

## macOS
{: #macos }

```
jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    macos: # executor type
      xcode: 12.5.1

    steps:
      # Commands run in a macOS virtual machine environment
      # with Xcode 12.5.1 installed
```

## Windows
{: #windows }

The syntax for using the Windows executor in your config differs depending on whether you are using:

* The cloud version of CircleCI, using config version 2.1 and the Windows orb.
* Self-hosted installation of CircleCI server with config version 2.0 – this option is an instance of using the `machine` executor with a Windows image – _Introduced in CircleCI server v2.18.3_.

{:.tab.windowsblock.Cloud}
```yml
version: 2.1 # Use version 2.1 to enable orb usage.

orbs:
  win: circleci/windows@2.2.0 # The Windows orb give you everything you need to start using the Windows executor.

jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    executor: win/default # executor type

    steps:
      # Commands are run in a Windows virtual machine environment
      - checkout
      - run: Write-Host 'Hello, Windows'
```


{:.tab.windowsblock.Server_3}
```yml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    machine: # executor type
      image: windows-default
    resource_class: windows.medium
    steps:
      # Commands are run in a Windows virtual machine environment
      - checkout
      - run: Write-Host 'Hello, Windows'
```

{:.tab.windowsblock.Server_2}
```yaml
version: 2

jobs:
  build: # name of your job
    machine: # executor type
      image: windows-default
    resource_class: windows.medium
    steps:
      # Commands are run in a Windows virtual machine environment
      - checkout
      - run: Write-Host 'Hello, Windows'
```

Find out more about the `windows` executor in the [Using the Windows executor]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/#using-the-windows-executor) section of the Choosing an Executor Type page. See [the Windows orb details](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/windows) for the list of options available in the Windows orb.
