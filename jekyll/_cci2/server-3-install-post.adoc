== Phase 4: Post installation

=== Set up backup and restore

Backups of CircleCI server can be created through https://kots.io/[KOTS].
To enable backup support, you will need to install and configure https://velero.io/[Velero] on your cluster. Velero was listed in the installation prerequisites section, so you should already have it.

=== Server 3.x backups on AWS

These instructions were sourced from the Velero documentation https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws#setup[here].

==== Step 1 - Create an AWS S3 bucket

[source,bash]
----
BUCKET=<YOUR_BUCKET>
REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --region $REGION \
    --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=$REGION
----
NOTE: `us-east-1` does not support a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html#API_CreateBucket_RequestBody[LocationConstraint]. If your region is `us-east-1`, omit the bucket configuration.

==== Step 2 - Set up permissions for Velero

* Create an IAM user

[source,bash]
----
aws iam create-user --user-name velero
----

* Attach policies to give user `velero` the necessary permissions:

[source,bash]
----
cat > velero-policy.json <<EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:CreateVolume",
                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
EOF
----

[source,bash]
----
aws iam put-user-policy \
  --user-name velero \
  --policy-name velero \
  --policy-document file://velero-policy.json
----

* Create an access key for user `velero`

[source,bash]
----
aws iam create-access-key --user-name velero
----

The result should look like this:
[source,bash]
----
{
  "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "velero",
        "Status": "Active",
        "CreateDate": "2017-07-31T22:24:41.576Z",
        "SecretAccessKey": <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>,
        "AccessKeyId": <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
  }
}
----

* Create a Velero-specific credentials file (for example: `./credentials-velero`) in your local directory, with the following contents:

[source,bash]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
----
where the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` placeholders are values returned from the `create-access-key` request in the previous step.

==== Step 3 - Install and start Velero

* Run the following `velero` `install` command. This creates a namespace called `velero` and installs all the necessary resources to run Velero.
Make sure that you pass the correct file name containing the AWS credentials that you created in <<Step 2 - Setup permissions for Velero, Step 2>>.

NOTE: KOTS backups require https://restic.net/[restic] to operate. When installing Velero, ensure that you have the `--use-restic` flag set, as shown below:

[source, bash]
----
velero install \
    --provider aws \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.2.0 \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --backup-location-config region=$REGION \
    --snapshot-location-config region=$REGION \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
    --use-restic \
    --wait
----

* Once Velero is installed on your cluster, check the new `velero` namespace. You should have a Velero deployment and a restic daemonset, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --namespace velero
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
restic-5vlww              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-94ptv              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-ch6m9              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-mknws              1/1     Running   0          2m
velero-68788b675c-dm2s7   1/1     Running   0          2m
----

As restic is a daemonset, there should be one pod for each node in your Kubernetes cluster.

=== Server 3.x backups on GCP

The following steps are specific for Google Cloud Platform and it is assumed you have met the <<prerequisites, prerequisites>>.

These instructions were sourced from the documentation for the Velero GCP plugin https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#setup[here].

==== Step 1 - Create a GCP bucket
To reduce the risk of typos, you can set some of the parameters as shell variables. Should you be unable to complete all the steps in the same session, do not forget to reset variables as necessary before proceeding. In the step below, for example, you can define a variable for your bucket name. Replace the `<YOUR_BUCKET>` placeholder with the name of the bucket you want to create for your backups.

[source,bash]
----
BUCKET=<YOUR_BUCKET>

gsutil mb gs://$BUCKET/
----

==== Step 2 - Setup permissions for Velero

If your server installation runs within a GKE cluster, ensure that your current IAM user is a cluster admin for this cluster, as RBAC objects need to be created. More information can be found in the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#iam-rolebinding-bootstrap[GKE documentation].

. First, you will set a shell variable for your project ID. To do so, make sure that your `gcloud` CLI points to the correct project by looking at the current configuration:
+
[source,bash]
----
gcloud config list
----

. If the project is correct, set the variable:
+
[source,bash]
----
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
----

. Create a service account:
+
[source,bash]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts create velero \
    --display-name "Velero service account"
----
NOTE: If you run several clusters with Velero, consider using a more specific name for the Service Account besides `velero`, as suggested above.

. You can check if the service account has been created successfully by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts list
----

. Next, store the email address for the Service Account in a variable:
+
[source,bash]
----
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
  --filter="displayName:Velero service account" \
  --format 'value(email)')
----
Modify the command as needed to match the display name you have chosen for your Service Account.

. Grant the necessary permissions to the Service Account:
+
[source,bash]
----
ROLE_PERMISSIONS=(
    compute.disks.get
    compute.disks.create
    compute.disks.createSnapshot
    compute.snapshots.get
    compute.snapshots.create
    compute.snapshots.useReadOnly
    compute.snapshots.delete
    compute.zones.get
)

gcloud iam roles create velero.server \
    --project $PROJECT_ID \
    --title "Velero Server" \
    --permissions "$(IFS=","; echo "${ROLE_PERMISSIONS[*]}")"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --role projects/$PROJECT_ID/roles/velero.server

gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL:objectAdmin gs://${BUCKET}
----

Now you need to ensure that Velero can use this Service Account.

[discrete]
===== Option 1: JSON key file

You can simply pass a JSON credentials file to Velero to authorize it to perform actions as the Service Account. To do this, you first need to create a key:
[source,bash]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create credentials-velero \
    --iam-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
----
After running this command, you should see a file named `credentials-velero` in your local working directory.

[discrete]
===== Option 2: Workload Identities

If you are already using https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Workload Identities] in your cluster, you can bind the GCP Service Account you just created to Velero's Kubernetes service account. In this case, the GCP Service Account needs the
`iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` role in addition to the permissions already specified above.

NOTE: If you are switching from static JSON credentials to Workload Identity, you should delete the keys from GCP as well as from CircleCI KOTS Admin Console.

==== Step 3 - Install and start Velero

* Run one of the following `velero` `install` commands, depending on how you authorized the service account. This creates a namespace called `velero` and installs all the necessary resources to run Velero.

NOTE: KOTS backups require https://restic.net/[restic] to operate. When installing Velero, ensure that you have the `--use-restic` flag set.

[discrete]
===== If using a JSON key file

[source, bash]
----
velero install \
    --provider gcp \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-gcp:v1.2.0 \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
    --use-restic \
    --wait
----

[discrete]
===== If using Workload Identities

[source,bash]
----
velero install \
    --provider gcp \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-gcp:v1.2.0 \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --no-secret \
    --sa-annotations iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --backup-location-config serviceAccount=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --use-restic \
    --wait
----

For more options on customizing your installation, refer to the https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#install-and-start-velero[Velero documentation].

* Once Velero is installed on your cluster, check the new `velero` namespace. You should have a Velero deployment and a restic daemonset, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --namespace velero
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
restic-5vlww              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-94ptv              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-ch6m9              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-mknws              1/1     Running   0          2m
velero-68788b675c-dm2s7   1/1     Running   0          2m
----

As restic is a daemonset, there should be one pod for each node in your Kubernetes cluster.

* S3-COMPATIBLE SETUP *

////
=== Server 3.x backups with S3 Compatible Storage

The following steps assume you are using S3-compatible object storage, but not necessarily AWS S3, for your backups.
It is also assumed you have met the <<s3-compatible-storage-prerequisites, prerequisites>>.

These instructions were sourced from the Velero documentation https://velero.io/docs/v1.6/contributions/minio/[here].

==== Step 1 - Configure `mc` client

To start, configure https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/reference/minio-mc.html[`mc`] to connect to your storage provider:

[source,bash]
----
# Alias can be any name as long as you use the same value in subsequent commands
export ALIAS=my-provider
mc alias set $ALIAS <YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT> <YOUR_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID> <YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
----

You can verify your client is correctly configured by running `mc ls my-provider` and you should see the buckets in your provider enumerated in the output.

==== Step 2 - Create a bucket

Create a bucket for your backups. It is important that a new bucket is used, as Velero cannot use a preexisting bucket that contains other content.

[source, bash]
----
mc mb ${ALIAS}/<YOUR_BUCKET>
----

==== Step 3 - Create a user and policy

Next, create a user and policy for Velero to access your bucket.

NOTE: In the following snippet `<YOUR_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` and `<YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` refer to the credentials used by Velero to access MinIO.

[source, bash]
----
# Create user
mc admin user add $ALIAS <YOUR_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID> <YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

# Create policy
cat > velero-policy.json << EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

mc admin policy add $ALIAS velero-policy velero-policy.json

# Bind user to policy
mc admin policy set $ALIAS velero-policy user=<YOUR_VELERO_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
----

Finally, you add your new user's credentials to a file (`./credentials-velero` in
this example) with the following contents:

[source,toml]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_VELERO_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOUR_VELERO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
----

==== Step 4 - Install and start Velero

Run the following `velero install` command. This creates a namespace called `velero` and installs all the necessary resources to run Velero.

NOTE: KOTS backups require https://restic.net/[restic] to operate. When installing Velero, ensure that you have the `--use-restic` flag set, as shown below:

[source, bash]
----
velero install --provider aws \
  --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.2.0 \
  --bucket <YOUR_BUCKET> \
  --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
  --use-volume-snapshots=false \
  --use-restic \
  --backup-location-config region=minio,s3ForcePathStyle="true",s3Url=<YOUR_ENDPOINT> \
  --wait
----

Once Velero is installed on your cluster, check the new `velero` namespace. You
should have a Velero deployment and a restic daemonset, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --namespace velero
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
restic-5vlww              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-94ptv              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-ch6m9              1/1     Running   0          2m
restic-mknws              1/1     Running   0          2m
velero-68788b675c-dm2s7   1/1     Running   0          2m
----

As restic is a daemonset, there should be one pod for each node in your
Kubernetes cluster.

=== Creating backups
Now that Velero is installed on your cluster, you should see the snapshots option in the navbar of the management console.

image::kots-admin-navbar-snapshot-option.png[Kots Navbar]

If you see this option, you are ready to create your first backup. If you do not see this option, please refer to the
https://circleci.com/docs/server-3-operator-backup-and-restore/#troubleshooting-backups-and-restoration[troubleshooting] section.

==== Option 1 - Create a backup with KOTS CLI

To create the backup, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl kots backup --namespace <your namespace>
----

==== Option 2 - Create a backup with KOTS Admin Console

Select *Snapshots* from the navbar. The default selection should be *Full Snapshots*, which is recommended.

image::kots-admin-full-snapshot.png[Kots Navbar]

Click the *Start a snapshot* button.

image::kots-admin-create-backup.png[Kots Create Snapshot]


=== Orbs 

Server installations include their own local orb registry. This registry is private to the server installation. All orbs referenced in project configs reference the orbs in the _server_ orb registry. You are responsible for maintaining orbs. This includes: 

* Copying orbs from the public registry.
* Updating orbs that may have been copied previously.
* Registering your company's private orbs, if you have any.

For more information and steps to complete these tasks, see the https://circleci.com/docs/server-3-operator-orbs/[Orbs on Server guide].

=== Email Notifications 

Build notifications are sent by email. This section has details on how to set up build notifications by email. 

Access the KOTS admin console. Get to the KOTS admin console by running the following, substituting your namespace: 

[source,shell]
----
kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

Locate the *Email Notifications* section in *Settings* and fill in the following details to configure email notifications for your installation.

Locate the *Email Notifications* section in *Settings* and fill in the following details to configure email notifications for your installation:

* *Email Submission server hostname (required)* - Host name of the submission server (for example, for Sendgrid use smtp.sendgrid.net).

* *Username (required)* - Username to authenticate to submission server. This is commonly the same as the user’s email address.

* *Password (required)* - Password to authenticate to submission server.

* *Port (optional)* - Port of the submission server. This is usually either 25 or 587. While port 465 is also commonly used for email submission, it is often used with implicit TLS instead of StartTLS. Server only supports StartTLS for encrypted submission. 
+
NOTE: Outbound connections on port 25 are blocked on most cloud providers. Should you select this port, be aware that your notifications may fail to send.

* *Enable StartTLS* - Enabling this will encrypt mail submission. 
+
NOTE: StartTLS is used to encrypt mail by default, and you should only disable this if you can otherwise guarantee the confidentiality of traffic.

* *Email from address (required)* - The _from_ address for the email.  

Click the *Save config* button to update your installation and redeploy server.
