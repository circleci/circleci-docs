This guide introduces some basic concepts to help you understand how CircleCI manages your CICD pipelines.

* TOC 
{:toc}

## Projects

A CircleCI project shares the name of the associated code repository in your VCS (GitHub or Bitbucket). Select Add Project from the CircleCI application to enter the Projects dashboard, from where you can set up and follow the projects you have access to.

On the Projects Dashboard, you can either:
* _Set Up_ any project that you are the owner of in your VCS 
* _Follow_ any project in your organization to gain access to its pipelines and to subscribe to [email notifications]({{
site.baseurl }}/2.0/notifications/) for the project's status.

## Configuration

CircleCI believes in *configuration as code*. Your entire continuous integration and deployment process is orchestrated through a single file called `config.yml`.  The `config.yml` file is located in a folder called `.circleci` at the root of your project. CircleCI uses the YAML syntax for config, see the [Writing YAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/writing-yaml/) document for basics.

```bash
├── .circleci
│   ├── config.yml
├── README
└── all-other-project-files-and-folders
```

`config.yml` is a powerful YAML file that defines the entire pipeline for your project. For a full overview of the various keys that are used, see the [Configuration Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) page for more information. 

Your CircleCI configuration can be adapted to fit many different needs of your project. The following terms, sorted in order of granularity and dependence, describe the components of most common CircleCI projects:

- **[Pipeline](#pipelines)**: Represents the entirety of your configuration. Available in CircleCI Cloud only.
- **[Workflows](#workflows)**: Responsible for orchestrating multiple _jobs_.
- **[Jobs](#jobs)**: Responsible for running a series of _steps_ that perform commands.
- **[Steps](#steps)**: Run commands (such as installing dependencies or running tests) and shell scripts to do the work required for your project. 

The following image uses an [example Java application](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-java-spring/tree/2.1-config) to show the various config elements:

![configuration elements]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/config-elements.png)

## User types
  
It is worth taking a minute to define the various user types that relate to CircleCI projects, most of which have permissions inherited from VCS accounts.

* The *Organization Administrator* is a permission level inherited from your VCS:
  * GitHub: **Owner** and following at least one project building on CircleCI
  * Bitbucket: **Admin** and following at least one project building on CircleCI
* The *Project Administrator* is the user who adds a GitHub or Bitbucket
repository to CircleCI as a Project. 
* A *User* is an individual user within an organization, inherited from your VCS. 
* A CircleCI user is anyone who can log in to the CircleCI platform with a
username and password. Users must be added to a [GitHub or Bitbucket org]({{
site.baseurl }}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/) to view or follow associated CircleCI
projects. Users may not view project data that is stored in environment variables.


## Pipelines

A CircleCI pipeline is the full set of processes you run when you trigger work on your projects. Pipelines encompass your workflows, which in turn coordinate your jobs. This is all defined in your project [configuration file](#configuration). Pipelines are not currently available for CircleCI Server.

Pipelines represent methods for interacting with your configuration:

{% include snippets/pipelines-benefits.adoc %}

## Orbs

Orbs are reusable snippets of code that help automate repeated processes, speed up project setup, and make it easy to integrate with third-party tools. See [Using Orbs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/using-orbs/) for details about how to use orbs in your config and an introduction to orb design. Visit the [Orbs Registry](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs) to search for orbs to help simplify your config. Orbs are not currently available for CircleCI Server.

The graphic above illustrating an example Java configuration can be greatly simplified using orbs. The following illustration re-creates the same configuration with [the Maven orb](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-java-spring/tree/2.1-orbs-config).

![config elements orbs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/config-elements-orbs.png)

## Jobs

Jobs are the building blocks of your config. Jobs are collections of [steps](#steps), which run commands/scripts as required. Each job must declare an executor that is either `docker`, `machine`, `windows` or `macos`. `machine` includes a [default image](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-intro/#machine) if not specified, for `docker` you must [specify an image](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-intro/#docker) to use for the primary container, for `macos` you must specify an [Xcode version](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-intro/#macos), and for `windows` you must use the [Windows orb](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-intro/#windows).

![job illustration]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/job.png)

## Executors and images

Each separate job defined within your config will run in a unique executor. An executor can be a docker container or a virtual machine running Linux, Windows, or MacOS. Note, macOS is not currently available on self-hosted installations of CircleCI Server.

![job illustration]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/executor_types.png)

You can define an image for each executor. An image is a packaged system that has the instructions for creating a running container or virtual machine. CircleCI provide a range of images for use with the Docker executor. For more information see the [Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/circleci-images/) guide.

 build3:
   macos: # Specifies a macOS virtual machine with Xcode version 11.3
     xcode: "11.3.0"
# ...          
```

The Primary Container is defined by the first image listed in [`.circleci/config.yml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) file. This is where commands are executed. The Docker executor spins up a container with a Docker image. The machine executor spins up a complete Ubuntu virtual machine image. See [Choosing an Executor Type]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/) document for a comparison table and considerations. Subsequent images can be added to spin up Secondary/Service Containers.

When using the docker executor and running docker commands, the `setup_remote_docker` key can be used to spin up another docker container in which to run these commands, for added security. For more information see the [Running Docker Commands]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/building-docker-images/#accessing-the-remote-docker-environment) guide.

## Steps

Steps are actions that need to be taken to complete your job. Steps are usually a collection of executable commands. For example, the [`checkout`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#checkout) step, which is a _built-in_ step available across all CircleCI projects, checks out the source code for a job over SSH. Then, the `run` step allows you to run custom commands, such as executing the command `make test`  using a non-login shell by default. Commands can also be defined [outside the job declaration]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#commands-requires-version-21), making them reusable across your config.

```yaml
#...
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: <image-name-tag>
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - checkout # Special step to checkout your source code
      - run: # Run step to execute commands, see
      # circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run
          name: Running tests
          command: make test # executable command run in
          # non-login shell with /bin/bash -eo pipefail option
          # by default.
#...          
```          

## Image

An image is a packaged system that has instructions for creating a running container. 
The Primary Container is defined by the first image listed in a [`.circleci/config.yml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) file. This is where commands are executed for jobs using the Docker or machine executor. The Docker executor spins up a container with a Docker image. The machine executor spins up a complete Ubuntu virtual machine image. See the [Choosing an Executor Type]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/) document for a comparison table and considerations.

 ```yaml

 jobs:
   build1: # job name
     docker: # Specifies the primary container image,
     # see circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/ for
     # the list of pre-built CircleCI images on dockerhub.
       - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
         auth:
           username: mydockerhub-user
           password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference

       - image: postgres:9.4.1 # Specifies the database image
         auth:
           username: mydockerhub-user
           password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
        # for the secondary or service container run in a common
        # network where ports exposed on the primary container are
        # available on localhost.
         environment: # Specifies the POSTGRES_USER authentication
          # environment variable, see circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/
          # for instructions about using environment variables.
           POSTGRES_USER: root
...
   build2:
     machine: # Specifies a machine image that uses
     # an Ubuntu version 16.04 image
     # follow CircleCI Discuss Announcements
     # for new image releases.
       image: ubuntu-1604:202007-01
...       
   build3:
     macos: # Specifies a macOS virtual machine with Xcode version 9.0
       xcode: "9.0"       
 ...          
 ```

## Workflows

Workflows define a list of jobs and their run order. It is possible to run jobs concurrently, sequentially, on a schedule, or with a manual gate using an approval job.

![workflows illustration]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/workflow_detail.png)

The following config example shows a workflow called `build_and_test` in which the job `build1` runs and then jobs `build2` and `build3` run concurrently:

## Caches, workspaces and artifacts

![workflow illustration]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/workspaces.png)

A cache stores a file or directory of files such as dependencies or source code in object storage. Each job may contain special steps for caching dependencies from previous jobs to speed up the build.

If there comes a time when you need to [clear your cache](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/#clearing-cache), refer to the [Caching Dependencies](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/) page for more information on caching.

Workspaces are a workflow-aware storage mechanism. A workspace stores data unique to the job, which may be needed in downstream jobs. Each workflow has a temporary workspace associated with it. The workspace can be used to pass along unique data built during a job to other jobs in the same workflow.

Artifacts persist data after a workflow is completed and may be used for longer-term storage of the outputs of your build process.

Note the following distinctions between Artifacts, Workspaces, and Caches:

Type       | Lifetime             | Use                                | Example
-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------
Artifacts  | Months               | Preserve long-term artifacts.      |  Available in the Artifacts tab of the **Job page** under the `tmp/circle-artifacts.<hash>/container` or similar directory.
Workspaces | Duration of workflow | Attach the workspace in a downstream container with the `attach_workspace:` step. | The `attach_workspace` copies and re-creates the entire workspace content when it runs.
Caches     | Months               | Store non-vital data that may help the job run faster, for example npm or Gem packages. | The `save_cache` job step with a `path` to a list of directories to add and a `key` to uniquely identify the cache (for example, the branch, build number, or revision). Restore the cache with `restore_cache` and the appropriate `key`.
