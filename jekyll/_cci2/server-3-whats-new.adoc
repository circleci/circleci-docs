:toc-title:

Server 3.0 is now generally available. The newest version of server offers the ability to scale under heavy workloads,
all within your own Kubernetes cluster and private network, while still enjoying the full CircleCI cloud experience.
Server 3.0 includes the latest CircleCI features, such as orbs, scheduled workflows, matrix jobs, and more. For existing
customers interested in migrating from 2.19 to 3.x, contact your customer success manager. Server 3.0 will receive monthly
patch releases and quarterly feature releases.

== New Features

* New UI
* Orbs for Server
* Pipelines
* Config 2.1
* API 2.0
* Scheduled Workflows
* Matrix Jobs
* And much more...

== Known Issues

* No support for external data stores (Postgres, Mongo, Vault). This feature will be implemented in a future release.
* It is currently possible for multiple organizations under the same CircleCI server account to have contexts with
identical names. This should be avoided as doing so could lead to errors and unexpected behavior. This will be fixed in
a future patch release.
* CircleCI 1.0 builds are not supported. If an attempt is made to run a 1.0 build, no feedback will be available in the
application to indicate the cause of the issue. If a build is run on your installation and does not show up in the
CircleCI application, users should be directed to use the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/[CircleCI CLI] to validate the project configuration
and get details of the possible cause of the issue.
* Account contexts are not usable in v3.0. This feature will be fixed in a future release.
* Installing the system into private subnets is possible, but in EKS, the frontend-external service will require an
annotation that will not persist upgrades: `kubectl -n <namespace> annotate service frontend-external service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal="true"`
  ** Additionally, the private subnets need to be tagged with the following:
     *** ``"kubernetes.io/cluster/${CLUSTER_NAME}"    = "shared"``
     *** ``"kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"          = "1"``
* CircleCI currently assigns a public load balancer for the frontend services. For some customers, their infrastructure
or security groups wonâ€™t allow this. We will provide an optional internal local balancer for the frontend services in a future release.
