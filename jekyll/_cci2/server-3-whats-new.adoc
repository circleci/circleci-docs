:toc-title:

Server 3.0 is now generally available. The newest version of server offers the ability to scale under heavy workloads,
all within your own Kubernetes cluster and private network, while still enjoying the full CircleCI cloud experience.

Server 3.0 includes the latest CircleCI features, such as orbs, scheduled workflows, matrix jobs, and more. For existing
customers interested in migrating from 2.19 to 3.x, contact your customer success manager. Server 3.0 will receive monthly
patch releases and quarterly feature releases.

== New Features

* New UI
* Orbs for Server
* Pipelines
* Config 2.1
* API 2.0
* Scheduled Workflows
* Matrix Jobs
* And much more...

== Known Issues

* No support for external data stores (Postgres, Mongo, Vault). This feature will be implemented in a future release.
* It is currently possible for multiple organizations under the same CircleCI server account to have contexts with
identical names. This should be avoided as doing so could lead to errors and unexpected behavior. This will be fixed in
a future patch release.
* CircleCI 1.0 builds are not supported. If an attempt is made to run a 1.0 build, no feedback will be available in the
application to indicate the cause of the issue. If a build is run on your installation and does not show up in the
CircleCI application, users should be directed to use the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/[CircleCI CLI] to validate the project configuration
and get details of the possible cause of the issue.
* CircleCI currently assigns a public load balancer for the frontend services. For some customers, their infrastructure
or security groups wonâ€™t allow this. We will provide an optional internal local balancer for the frontend services in a future release.
* https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.18/[Telegraf] metrics collection customization is not yet available.

== Release 3.0.2

- Resolved a bug relating to artifacts disappearing after 30 days. The default settings for the artifact retention period have been updated to unlimited, and can be adjusted from the KOTS Admin Console.
- Resolved a bug that made Traefik "unaware" of TLS certificate updates without requiring a manual restart of the Traefik pod. The Traefik pod will now restart automatically after any TLS certificate updates go into effect after the initial post KOTS deployment.
- Resolved a bug in `builds-service` that was causing pods to crash as a result of running out of memory.

== Release 3.0.1

- `build_agent` `version` value updated, as the previous version was relying on a vulnerable version of PsExec.
- Due to an issue that was causing duplicated checks in GitHub, environment variables for `output-processor` were reconfigured.
- Adjusted deployment configuration for `vm-service` to handle out-of-order database migrations managed by Flyway.
