In this how-to guide, you will learn how to configure CircleCI to deploy to Firebase.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

This page provides a configuration for deployment to Firebase. In order to deploy to Firebase you will need to add `firebase-tools` to your project's devDependencies since attempting to install `firebase-tools` globally in CircleCI will not work.

[#install-firebase-tools]
== 1. Install tools

```shell
npm install --save-dev firebase-tools
```

[#generate-cli-token]
== 2. Generate CLI token

Generate a Firebase CLI token using the following command:

```shell
firebase login:ci
```

[#add-token-to-project-env-vars]
== 3. Add token to project's environment variables

Add the generated token to the CircleCI project's environment variables as `$FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN`. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

[#deploy-example]
== Deploy example

The following example shows how you can add a Firebase deploy job to your project's `.circleci/config.yml` file. This snippet assumes you already have a job to build your application, called `build-job`, and introduces a deployment workflow that only runs the deployment job once the build job has completed **and** you are on the main branch.

```yaml
  version: 2.1

  deploy-job:
    docker:
      - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
    working_directory: /tmp/my-project
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Deploy Main to Firebase
          command: ./node_modules/.bin/firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN

workflows:
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-job
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - build-job
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main

```

[#google-cloud-functions]
== Google Cloud Functions

If you are using Google Cloud Functions with Firebase, instruct CircleCI to navigate to the folder where the Google Cloud Functions are held (in this case 'functions') and run `npm install` by adding the below to `.circleci/config.yml`:

```yaml
    - run: cd functions && npm install
```
