In this how-to guide, you will learn how to configure CircleCI to deploy to Firebase.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

This page provides a configuration for deployment to Firebase. In order to deploy to Firebase you will need to add `firebase-tools` to your project's devDependencies since attempting to install `firebase-tools` globally in CircleCI will not work.

[#install-firebase-tools]
== 1. Install tools

[source,shell]
----
npm install --save-dev firebase-tools
----

[#authenticate-with-a-service-account]
== 2. Authenticate with a service account

If you have not already done so, link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create[create a Google Cloud service account] with the appropriate access for the deploy job. 

Then, link:https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#wlif-key[create a service account key]. You may store the key file contents in your project's environment variables (in this guide, we name the project environment variable `$SA_KEY`). Refer to the xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[Set an enironment variable in a project] guide for instructions. CircleCI will use this credential to authenticate with Firebase. 

{% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

NOTE: Review the link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-managing-service-account-keys[Google IAM documentation] for best practices in managing service account keys. 

[#add-token-to-project-env-vars]
== 3. Declare environment variable inside `run` step

. Inside a `run` step, output the value of the environment variable, that is, the contents of the service account key file, to a JSON file. 

. Set the JSON file path as the value of an environment variable `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` xref:env-vars#order-of-precedence[declared in the shell]. Then, run the Firebase deploy command. 

[source,yaml]
----
      - run:
          name: Deploy on Firebase
          command: |
            echo $SA_KEY > credentials.json
            GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials.json firebase deploy
----

To learn more about how Google finds application credentials, refer to the link:https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC[documentation for Google Cloud authentication].

[#deploy-example]
== Deploy example

The following example shows how you can add a Firebase deploy job to your project's `.circleci/config.yml` file. This snippet assumes you already have a job to build your application, called `build-job`, and introduces a deployment workflow that only runs the deployment job once the build job has completed **and** you are on the main branch.

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

deploy-job:
  docker:
    - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
  working_directory: /tmp/my-project
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Deploy on Firebase
        command: |
          echo $SA_KEY > credentials.json
          GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials.json firebase deploy

workflows:
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-job
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - build-job
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main

[#google-cloud-functions]
== Google Cloud Functions

If you are using Google Cloud Functions with Firebase, instruct CircleCI to navigate to the folder where the Google Cloud Functions are held (in this case 'functions') and run `npm install` by adding the below to `.circleci/config.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
    - run: cd functions && npm install
----
