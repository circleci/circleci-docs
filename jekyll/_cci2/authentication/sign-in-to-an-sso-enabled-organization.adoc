== Join an organization

To join a CircleCI organization that has SSO enabled you must first have an active CircleCI account that you log into with an email and password or with social logins like GitHub or Bitbucket. For more information on creating a CircleCI account, see the xref:../first-steps#[Sign up and try] page.

NOTE: If you use a OAuth/social login to join CircleCI, it is important to SSO authorize in GitHub/Bitbucket as well as in CircleCI.

Once you have a CircleCI account you can join an SSO-enabled CircleCI organization in one of the following ways:

* Get xref:../manage-roles-and-permissions#add-people-to-your-organization[an invite].
* Visit the CircleCI link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[home page]. Select the **Join Organisation** dropdown, and then select the option to **Join via SSO**.

== Authenticate with SSO for an organization

You must be logged in to your CircleCI account in order to authenticate with SSO for an organization.

If you have authenticated with an SSO-enabled CircleCI organization previously and your session has expired, the next time you attempt to access your organization's resources, you will be redirected to your org's Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate before being granted access once again.

When your session expires, you will be prompted to re-authenticate.
