This guide gets you started with the CircleCI Slack orb.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Orbs are shareable packages of reusable configuration elements. They help you reduce complexity, integrate your software with third-party apps, and save time.

One of CircleCI's most popular orbs is the Slack orb. The Slack orb allows you to implement event-based notifications across all your CI/CD pipelines. Using either built-in message templates or Slack's visual Block Kit Builder, you can create and customize notifications specific to your organization's needs.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Create a `config.yml` file using the Slack orb.
* Store your Slack credentials securely in a context.
* Use templates to create alerts for successful and failed builds.
* Alert specific channels, teams, or people.
* Access the Slack Block Kit Builder to create your own customized alerts.

To follow this tutorial, you need:

* A CircleCI account (you can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free]) connected to either GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.
* A https://slack.com[Slack workspace] (you can create your own for testing purposes, if you do not want to use your company workspace).
* A project you are following in CircleCI for which you want to integrate Slack notifications. See the xref:getting-started#[Quickstart guide] for help with following a project.

[#create-your-config-file]
== 1. Create your config.yml file

If you have not already done so, create a `.circleci` folder at the root of your repo. Inside the `.circleci` folder, create a `config.yml` file.

The sample code below shows the basics you need to set up Slack notifications into your `config.yml` file. You can copy and paste the whole thing or take the individual elements and incorporate into your project `config.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@4.9.3
jobs:
  notify:
    docker:
      - image: 'cimg/base:stable'
    steps:
      - slack/notify:
          custom: |
            {
              "blocks": [
                {
                  "type": "section",
                  "fields": [
                    {
                      "type": "plain_text",
                      "text": "*This is a text notification*",
                      "emoji": true
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          event: always
workflows:
  send-notification:
    jobs:
      - notify
----

The following commentary describes what occurs in the main elements of the sample code:

* *Line 1:* This indicates the config version you are using. `2.1` is the most recent version.
* *Lines 2-3:* This is the orbs stanza. You are using the `slack: circleci/slack@4.9.3` orb.
* *Lines 5-7:* This is a job called `notify`, which is executed in a basic Docker container.
* *Lines 8-9:* This is a step which must be called `slack/notify` to work with the Slack orb.
* *Lines 10-24:* This custom block includes a basic notification from the Slack Block Kit Builder. As you can see, it is in JSON format. In Part 3, you will use more sophisticated templates.
* *Line 25:* The `event: always` parameter means this notification is triggered for _all_ event types. In Part 3, you will use different notifications for different events.
* *Line 30:* This references a CircleCI context where you will save your Slack credentials in Step 2.

Now you have a basic `config.yml` file set up, you can connect CircleCI with Slack.

IMPORTANT: If you commit your `config.yml` file at this point and trigger a pipeline, your build will fail. This is because you need to add your Slack credentials in the next step.

[#connect-circleci-with-slack]
== 2. Connect CircleCI with Slack

In this step, you will:

* Obtain an API token from Slack.
* Create a context to store those credentials in CircleCI.
* Trigger the pipeline so you receive a notification.

[#authenticate-your-application]
=== a. Authenticate your application

The Slack orb is an application that executes as part of your job on CircleCI. Before you can receive notifications, you need to authenticate your application.

==== i. Create a Slack app

. Visit https://api.slack.com/apps[*Your Apps* on the Slack API website] and click the green *Create an App* button.
+
image::slack-orb-create-app.png[Create a Slack app]
+
. Choose *From scratch*.
+
image::slack-orb-from-scratch.png[Choose From scratch]
+
. Give your app a name, for example, `CircleCI`, and select the Slack workspace in which you want to use it. You cannot change this workspace afterwards.
+
image::slack-orb-name-app.png[Name your Slack app]
+
. Click the green **Create App** button.

[#set-your-app-permissions]
==== ii. Set your app permissions

. On the Basic Information page, locate the **Permissions** tile under _Add features and functionality_.
+
image::slack-orb-permissions.png[Slack app Permissions]
+
. On the _OAuth & Permissions_ page, scroll down to **Scopes**. This is where you need to create the permissions for your Slack app.
+
image::slack-orb-add-scope.png[Add an OAuth Scope]
+
. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, click **Add an OAuth Scope**.
. The Slack orb needs permission to post chat messages and upload files, so create the following scopes:
* chat:write
* chat:write.public
* files:write
+
image::slack-orb-bot-token-scopes.png[Add Bot Token Scopes]

TIP: To receive Slack notifications in a private channel, you need to add your Slack app to that channel. Open the channel, click the photos of the channel members in the top right-hand corner, then click the *Integrations* tab. From here, you can add an app.

[#install-your-app]
==== iii. Install your app

. Once you have created your scopes, scroll up to the top of the page and click the **Install to Workspace** button.
+
image::slack-orb-install-workspace.png[Install to Workspace]
+
. You will then be asked to grant permission for the app to access your Slack workspace.
+
image::slack-orb-allow.png[Allow access]
+
. Click the disclosure triangle to double-check the permissions, then click the green **Allow** button.
. You should see a *Bot User OAuth Token*. Copy this token to your clipboard, ready to add it to CircleCI. Make sure you keep this private.
+
image::slack-orb-copy-token.png[Copy OAuth Token]

[#creating-a-context]
=== b. Create a context

In CircleCI, contexts allow you to secure and share environment variables across projects. Once you have created a context with your Slack credentials, you and your colleagues will be able to reuse them.

In CircleCI:

. Click the **Organization Settings** page.
+
image::slack-orb-organization-settings.png[Organization Settings]

. Under Context, click the blue *Create Context* button and add a unique name, such as `slack-secrets` (that is the name specified in the `config.yml` file above).
+
image::slack-orb-create-context.png[Create Context]

. Click the blue **Create Context** button.
. Click the name of the context you just created.
. Click the blue *Add Environment Variable* button and enter your first key value pair.
* The Environment Variable Name is `SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
* The value is your Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token.
+
image::slack-orb-environment-variable.png[Add Environment Variable]
+
. Click the **Add Environment Variable** button to save it.
. Click the blue **Add Environment Variable** button again.
* The Environment Variable Name is `SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL`.
* The value is the ID of the default Slack channel for posting your notifications. You can override this setting in your individual jobs.
+
TIP: To get the ID for your Slack channel, right-click the channel in Slack and choose **Copy Link**. The ID will be visible at the end of the URL and will be in this format: C034R26AM36.
+
image::slack-orb-copy-link.png[Copy Slack channel link]

. Include the `slack-secrets` context in your `notify` job as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  send-notification:
    jobs:
      - notify:
          context: slack-secrets
----

NOTE: You can reuse this context in other jobs and projects.

[#trigger-an-alert]
=== c. Trigger an alert

. Commit your `config.yml` file (and push it, if you are working remotely). This triggers your CircleCI pipeline, which uses the Slack orb with your credentials.
+
You should then see a green **Success** badge and a green tick next to your `notify` job.
+
image::slack-orb-success.png[Success]

. Click on your job to see what just happened. You should see the message body that was sent to Slack.

. Now open your Slack workspace. In the default channel you specified earlier, you should see the alert triggered by your CircleCI pipeline.
+
image::slack-orb-text-notification.png[Slack text notification]

Although this is a basic alert, you have achieved a lot already:

* Created a `.circleci/config.yml` file with the Slack orb.
* Created a context to store your Slack-related environment variables.
* Created a Slack app.

[#use-message-templates]
== 3. Use message templates

The Slack orb includes several notification templates you can use to notify your channel of various CircleCI events:

* `basic_success_1` - for _pass_ events where the job succeeded.
* `basic_fail_1` -  for _fail_ events, where the job failed.
* `success_tagged_deploy_1` - for successful deployments.
* `basic_on_hold_1` - for on-hold jobs that are awaiting approval.

To use these templates in your job, include the `event` and `template` parameters under `steps` in the `config.yml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  notify:
    docker:
      - image: 'cimg/base:stable'
    steps:
- slack/notify:
	  event: fail
	  template: basic_fail_1
- slack/notify:
	  event: pass
	  template: success_tagged_deploy_1
----

* *Line 7* specifies that the template on the next line is used for failed events.
* *Line 8* specifies the template to be used, in this case `basic_fail_1`.
* *Line 9* specifies that the template on the next line is used for pass events.
* *Line 10* specifies the template to be used, in this case `basic_success_1`.

Whereas in Step 1 you used an all-purpose alert, now you have included different steps according to whether the job has passed or failed. The Slack orb triggers the appropriate step.

Commit your updated `config.yml` file (and push it, if you are working remotely). Once the pipeline is complete, you should see a more sophisticated alert in your Slack channel.

image::slack-orb-deployment-successful.png[Deployment Successful alert]

[#including-additional-parameters]
=== a. Including additional parameters

You can also include a mention for a failed job, to alert a specific person or team:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
	event: fail
	mentions: '@EngineeringTeam'
	template: basic_fail_1
----

To notify multiple channels, place the IDs in quotes and separate them with a comma:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
    channel: 'ABCXYZ, ZXCBN'
    event: fail
    template: basic_fail_1

----

To restrict your alert to a specific branch, add a `branch_pattern` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
 - slack/notify:
      branch_pattern: main
      event: fail
      template: basic_fail_1
----

This is useful if you do not want to receive alerts for feature branches.

[#use-the-slack-block-kit-builder]
=== b. Use the Slack Block Kit Builder

If you would like to further customize your notifications, you can use the https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building[Slack Block Kit Builder]. This framework allows you to create sophisticated notifications, using images, form fields, and other interactive elements.

Once you have created your block (which is a JSON object), copy and paste it into your `config.yml` file within the `custom` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
    event: always
    custom: | # your custom notification goes here
      {
        "blocks": [
          {
            "type": "section",
            "fields": [
              {
                "type": "plain_text",
                "text": "*This is a text notification*",
                "emoji": true
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

----

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have configured the Slack orb to send CircleCI notifications to your Slack channel. You created a basic notification, built and authenticated your Slack app, and used templates.

For further configuration options, take a look at the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack[Slack orb documentation]. You can also find many more orbs in the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry].
