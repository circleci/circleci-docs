[#introduction]
== Introduction

Orbs are open source, shareable packages of reusable configuration elements. They help you reduce complexity, integrate your software with third-party apps, and save time.

One of CircleCI's most popular orbs is Slack. The Slack orb allows you to implement event-based notifications across all your CI/CD pipelines. Using either built-in message templates or Slack's visual Block Kit Builder, you can create and customize notifications specific to your organization's needs.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Create a `config.yml` file using the Slack orb.
* Store your Slack credentials securely in a context.
* Use templates to create alerts for successful and failed builds.
* Alert specific channels, teams, or people.
* Access the Slack Block Kit Builder to create your own customized alerts.

To follow this tutorial, you need:

* A CircleCI account - if you do not have an account, <<first-steps#,you can sign up for free>>.
* A Version Control System (VCS), such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
* A https://slack.com[Slack workspace] (you can create your own for testing purposes, if you do not want to use your company workspace).

[#step-one-create-your-config-file]
== Step one - Create your config.yml file

If you have not already done so, create a `.circleci` folder at the root of your repo. Inside the `.circleci` folder, create a `config.yml` file.

Copy and paste the sample code below into your `config.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
orbs: 
  slack: circleci/slack@4.9.3
jobs:
  notify:
    docker:
      - image: 'cimg/base:stable'
    steps:
      - slack/notify:
          custom: |
            {
              "blocks": [
                {
                  "type": "section",
                  "fields": [
                    {
                      "type": "plain_text",
                      "text": "*This is a text notification*",
                      "emoji": true
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          event: always
workflows:
  send-notification:
    jobs:
      - notify:
          context: slack-secrets
----

The following commentary describes what occurs in the main elements of the sample code:

* *Line 1:* This indicates the config version you are using. `2.1` is the most recent version.
* *Lines 2-3:* This is the orbs stanza. You are using the `slack: circleci/slack@4.9.3` orb.
* *Lines 5-7:* This is a job called _notify_, which is executed in a basic Docker container.
* *Lines 8-9:* This is a step which must be called _slack/notify_ to work with the Slack orb.
* *Lines 10-24:* This custom block includes a basic notification from the Slack Block Kit Builder. As you can see, it is in JSON format. In Part 3, you will use more sophisticated templates.
* *Line 25:* The `event: always` parameter means this notification is triggered for _all_ event types. In Part 3, you will use different notifications for different events.
* *Line 30:* This references a CircleCI context where you will save your Slack credentials in Step 2.

Now you have a basic `config.yml` file set up, you can connect CircleCI with Slack.

IMPORTANT: If you commit your `config.yml` file at this point and trigger a pipeline, your build will fail. This is because you need to add your Slack credentials in the next step.

[#step-two-connect-circleci-with-slack]
== Step two - Connect CircleCI with Slack

In this step, you will:

* Obtain an API token from Slack.
* Create a context to store those credentials in CircleCI.
* Trigger the pipeline so you receive a notification.

[#authenticating-your-application]
=== Authenticating your application

The Slack orb is an application that executes as part of your job on CircleCI. Before you can receive notifications, you need to authenticate your application. 

==== Creating a Slack app

. Visit https://api.slack.com/apps[*Your Apps* on the Slack API website] and click the green *Create an App* button.
+
image::slack-orb-create-app.png[Create a Slack app]
+
. Choose *From scratch*.
+
image::slack-orb-from-scratch.png[Choose From scratch]
+
. Give your app a name, for example, _CircleCI_, and select the Slack workspace in which you want to use it. You cannot change this workspace afterwards.
+
image::slack-orb-name-app.png[Name your Slack app]
+
. Click the green **Create App** button.

[#setting-your-app-permissions]
==== Setting your app permissions

. On the Basic Information page, locate the **Permissions** tile under _Add features and functionality_.
+
image::slack-orb-permissions.png[Slack app Permissions]
+
. On the _OAuth & Permissions_ page, scroll down to **Scopes**. This is where you need to create the permissions for your Slack app.
+
image::slack-orb-add-scope.png[Add an OAuth Scope]
+
. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, click **Add an OAuth Scope**.
. The Slack orb needs permission to post chat messages and upload files, so create the following scopes:
* chat:write
* chat:write.public
* files:write
+
image::slack-orb-bot-token-scopes.png[Add Bot Token Scopes]

TIP: To receive Slack notifications in a private channel, you need to add your Slack app to that channel. Open the channel, click the photos of the channel members in the top right-hand corner, then click the *Integrations* tab. From here, you can add an app.

[#installing-your-app]
==== Installing your app

. Once you have created your scopes, scroll up to the top of the page and click the **Install to Workspace** button.
+
image::slack-orb-install-workspace.png[Install to Workspace]
+
. You will then be asked to grant permission for the app to access your Slack workspace.
+
image::slack-orb-allow.png[Allow access]
+
. Click the disclosure triangle to double-check the permissions, then click the green **Allow** button.
. You should see a *Bot User OAuth Token*. Copy this token to your clipboard, ready to add it to CircleCI. Make sure you keep this private.
+
image::slack-orb-copy-token.png[Copy OAuth Token]

[#creating-a-context]
=== Creating a context

In CircleCI, contexts allow you to secure and share environment variables across projects. Once you have created a context with your Slack credentials, you and your colleagues will be able to reuse them.

In CircleCI:

. Click the _Organization Settings_ page.
+
image::slack-orb-organization-settings.png[Organization Settings]
+
. Under Context, click the blue *Create Context* button and add a unique name, such as _slack-secrets_ (that is the name specified in the `config.yml` file above).
+
image::slack-orb-create-context.png[Create Context]
+
. Click the blue **Create Context** button.
. Click the name of the context you just created.
. Click the blue *Add Environment Variable* button and enter your first key value pair. 
* The Environment Variable Name is `SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
* The value is your Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token.
+
image::slack-orb-environment-variable.png[Add Environment Variable]
+
. Click the Add Environment Variable button to save it.
. Click the blue **Add Environment Variable** button again.
* The Environment Variable Name is `SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL`.
* The value is the ID of the default Slack channel for posting your notifications. You can override this setting in your individual jobs.

TIP: To get the ID for your Slack channel, right-click the channel in Slack and choose **Copy Link**. The ID will be visible at the end of the URL and will be in this format: C034R26AM36.

image::slack-orb-copy-link.png[Copy Slack channel link]

Make sure you have included the _slack-secrets_ context in your _notify_ job and that the name matches what you created:

[source,yaml]
----
workflows:
  send-notification:
    jobs:
      - notify:
          context: slack-secrets
----

You can now reuse this context in other jobs and projects.

Commit your `config.yml` file (and push it, if you are working remotely).

[#triggering-an-alert]
==== Triggering an alert

In the CircleCI dashboard:

* Click **Projects**. 
* Find the repo and click the blue **Set Up Project** button next to it.
+
image::slack-orb-set-up-project.png[Set up Project]
+
* Choose the branch on which you committed your `config.yml` file
+
image::slack-orb-select-config-file.png[Select your config.yml file]
+
* Click the blue **Set Up Project** button.

This triggers your CircleCI pipeline, which contains a Slack orb with your credentials.

You should then see a green **Success** badge and a green tick next to your _notify_ job. 

image::slack-orb-success.png[Success]

Click on your job to see what just happened. You should see the message body that was sent to Slack.

Now open your Slack workspace. In the default channel you specified earlier, you should see the alert triggered by your CircleCI pipeline.

image::slack-orb-text-notification.png[Slack text notification]

Although this is a basic alert, you have achieved a lot already:

* Created a `.circleci/config.yml` file with the Slack orb.
* Created a context to store your Slack-related environment variables.
* Created a Slack app.

[#step-three-use-message-templates]
== Step three - Use message templates

The Slack orb includes several notification templates you can use to notify your channel of various CircleCI events:

* `basic_success_1` - for _pass_ events where the job succeeded.
* `basic_fail_1` -  for_fail_ events, where the job failed.
* `success_tagged_deploy_1` - for successful deployments.
* `basic_on_hold_1` - for on-hold jobs that are awaiting approval.

To use these templates in your job, include the `event` and `template` parameters under `steps` in the `config.yml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  notify:
    docker:
      - image: 'cimg/base:stable'
    steps:
- slack/notify:
	  event: fail
	  template: basic_fail_1
- slack/notify:
	  event: pass
	  template: success_tagged_deploy_1
----

* *Line 7* specifies that the template on the next line is used for failed events.
* *Line 8* specifies the template to be used, in this case `basic_fail_1`.
* *Line 9* specifies that the template on the next line is used for pass events.
* *Line 10* specifies the template to be used, in this case `basic_success_1`.

Whereas in Step 1 you used an all-purpose alert, now you have included different steps according to whether the job has passed or failed. The Slack orb triggers the appropriate step.

Commit your updated `config.yml` file (and push it, if you are working remotely). Once the pipeline is complete, you should see a more sophisticated alert in your Slack channel.

image::slack-orb-deployment-successful.png[Deployment Successful alert]

[#including-additional-parameters]
=== Including additional parameters

You can also include a mention for a failed job, to alert a specific person or team:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
	event: fail
	mentions: '@EngineeringTeam'
	template: basic_fail_1
----

To notify multiple channels, place the IDs in quotes and separate them with a comma:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
    channel: 'ABCXYZ, ZXCBN'
    event: fail
    template: basic_fail_1

----

To restrict your alert to a specific branch, add a _branch_pattern_ parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
 - slack/notify:
      branch_pattern: main
      event: fail
      template: basic_fail_1
----

This is useful if you do not want to receive alerts for feature branches.

==== Using the Slack Block Kit Builder

If you would like to further customize your notifications, you can use the https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building[Slack Block Kit Builder]. This framework allows you to create sophisticated notifications, using images, form fields, and other interactive elements.

Once you have created your block (which is a JSON object), copy and paste it into your `config.yml` file within the _custom_ parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
- slack/notify:
    event: always
    custom: | # your custom notification goes here
      {
        "blocks": [
          {
            "type": "section",
            "fields": [
              {
                "type": "plain_text",
                "text": "*This is a text notification*",
                "emoji": true
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

----

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have configured the Slack orb to send CircleCI notifications to your Slack channel. You created a basic notification, built and authenticated your Slack app, and used templates.

For further configuration options, take a look at the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack[Slack orb documentation]. You can also find many more orbs in the https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry].
