This document describes the Free plan available to developers.

[#free-plan]
== Free plan
As with the CircleCI legacy Container plan, CircleCI also supports a free-tier with the usage-based plan. By using the Free plan, you can take advantage of a large number of premium features that will allow your team to be more productive, efficient, and fast.

The Free usage-based plan offers a set amount of credits across a variety of resource classes, per month, which you can customize depending on your build configuration and execution environment. With this combination, a small number of credits are charged per minute and there is no limit on user seats.

The Free plan offers *unlimited users* - there is no limit to the number of users who can build and develop on CircleCI. This allows you to collaborate with different teams and groups within your organization (or open source) on multiple projects, increasing speed, productivity, and efficiency. With an unlimited number of users, you will have to manage your credit allotment accordingly, as there is a set amount of network and storage usage available.

Below are the features you can use on the Free plan. Refer to the https://circleci.com/pricing/[Pricing] page for more detailed information on credit amounts, included resource classes, key features, and support. Refer to the https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/[Resource class features] page for details on CPU, memory, network and storage, and credit usage for compute type on execution environments.

[#available-resource-classes]
=== Available resource classes 
A wide array of resource classes on Docker, Linux, Windows, and macOS are available to use. This flexibility helps ensure that you choose the right compute resources. To view examples, or find more information about these executors, please refer to the the <<executor-intro#,Executors and Images>> page.
