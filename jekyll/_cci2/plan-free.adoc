The Free Plan includes a set number of credits across a variety of resource classes, per month. You can customize how you use your credits depending on your build configuration and execution environment. A small number of credits are charged per minute.

The Free Plan offers *five* link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034783154-What-is-an-Active-User[active users]. Users beyond this limit are charged at 25,000 credits.

=== Releases

Visualise and control your deployments with CircleCI releases. Deployments to Kubernetes and SageMaker are supported.

On the Free Plan, you get **three components** with associated releases per month. Components with no releases are not charged. Each release is **250 credits**.

* A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit.

* A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services. A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

Start with the xref:deploy/deploys-overview#[Releases overview] for more information on the feature.
