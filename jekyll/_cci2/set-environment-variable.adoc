:page-description: How to set environment variables for use in your CircleCI pipelines.
:icons: font

Environment variables can be stored and configured for use in CircleCI jobs in several ways to provide variety in scope and authorization level.

include::../_includes/partials/notes/docker-auth.adoc[]

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-shell-command]
== Set an environment variable in a shell command

While CircleCI does not support interpolation when setting environment variables, it is possible to set variables for the current shell by xref:env-vars#parameters-and-bash-environment[using `BASH_ENV`]. This approach is useful for both modifying your `PATH` and setting environment variables that reference other variables.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Update PATH and Define Environment Variable at Runtime
          # Add source command to execute code and make variables
          # available in current step.
          command: |
            echo 'export PATH=/path/to/foo/bin:"$PATH"' >> "$BASH_ENV"
            echo "export VERY_IMPORTANT=VALUE_CONTENT" >> "$BASH_ENV"
            source "$BASH_ENV"
```

NOTE: Depending on your shell, you may have to append the new variable to a shell startup file like `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

For more information, refer to your shell's documentation on setting environment variables.

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-step]
== Set an environment variable in a step

To set an environment variable in a step, use the xref:configuration-reference#run[`environment` key].

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run migrations
          command: sql/docker-entrypoint.sh sql
          # Environment variable for a single command shell
          environment:
            DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/test_db
```

NOTE: Since every `run` step is a new shell, environment variables are not shared across steps. If you need an environment variable
to be accessible in more than one step, export the value xref:env-vars#parameters-and-bash-environment[using `BASH_ENV`].

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-job]
== Set an environment variable in a job

To set an environment variable in a job, use the xref:configuration-reference#job-name[`environment` key].

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2022.04-20.04
    environment:
      FOO: bar
```

NOTE: Integers longer than 6 digits will be converted to an exponential number. To avoid this, store them as a string instead (for example, "1234567").

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-context]
== Set an environment variable in a context

. On the CircleCI web app, go to **Organization Settings**.
+
image::org-settings-contexts-v2.png[Contexts]

. Select the context you want to associate your environment variable with, or create a new one by clicking the **Create Context** button.

. Select **Add Environment Variable** and enter a name and value.

. Use your new environment variable in your `.circleci/config.yml` once the context is added under the workflows key, as follows:
+
```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows:
  test-env-vars:
    jobs:
      - build:
          context: my_context_name # has an env var called MY_ENV_VAR

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "echo an env var that is part of our context"
          command: |
            echo $MY_ENV_VAR
```

Creating a context allows you to share environment variables across multiple projects, and control who has access. For more information about controlling access to environment variables with contexts, refer to the xref:contexts#restrict-a-context[Restricting a context] documentation.

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project]
== Set an environment variable in a project

. On the CircleCI web app, go to your project's settings. You can do this two ways: Navigate to **Projects** on the side navigation, and then click the ellipsis button in the project's row, or select the **Project Settings** button on the project's individual **Pipelines** page.
+
image::project-settings-env-var-v2.png[Environment Variables]

. Select **Environment Variables** in the side navigation.

. Select **Add Variable** to enter a name and value of the new environment variable.

. Use your new environment variables in your `.circleci/config.yml` as follows:
+
```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows:
  test-env-vars:
    jobs:
      - build

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "echo an env var that is part of our project"
          command: |
            echo $MY_ENV_VAR # this env var must be set within the project
```

Once created, environment variables are hidden and uneditable in the application. Changing an environment variable is only possible by deleting and recreating it.

[#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-container]
== Set an environment variable in a container

Environment variables can also be set for a Docker container. To do this, use the xref:configuration-reference#docker[`environment` key].

NOTE: Environment variables set in this way are not available to _steps_ run within the container, they are only available to the entrypoint/command run _by_ the container. By default, CircleCI will ignore the entrypoint for a job's primary container. For the primary container's environment variables to be useful, you will need to preserve the entrypoint. For more information, see the xref:custom-images#adding-an-entrypoint[Adding an entrypoint] section of the Custom images guide.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
        # environment variables available for entrypoint/command run by docker container
        environment:
          MY_ENV_VAR_1: my-value-1
          MY_ENV_VAR_2: my-value-2
```

The following example shows separate environment variable settings for the primary container image (listed first) and the secondary or service container image.

NOTE: While hard-coded environment variable values will be passed on correctly to the secondary or service container, contexts or project specific environment variables will not be interpolated for non-primary containers.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2023.06
        environment:
          MY_ENV_VAR_1: my-value-1
          MY_ENV_VAR_2: my-value-2
      - image: cimg/postgres:15.3.0
        environment:
          MY_ENV_VAR_3: my-value-3
          MY_ENV_VAR_4: my-value-4
```
[#encoding-multi-line-environment-variables]
=== Encoding multi-line environment variables

If you are having difficulty adding a multiline environment variable, use `base64` to encode it.

```shell
$ echo "foobar" | base64 --wrap=0
Zm9vYmFyCg==
```

Store the resulting value in a CircleCI environment variable.

```shell
$ echo $MYVAR
Zm9vYmFyCg==
```

Decode the variable in any commands that use the variable.

```shell
$ echo $MYVAR | base64 --decode | docker login -u my_docker_user --password-stdin
Login Succeeded
```

NOTE: Not all command-line programs take credentials in the same way that `docker` does.
