There are a few great tricks for triggering and scheduling builds in the following snippets!

## Skip Builds 

By default, CircleCI automatically builds a project whenever you push changes to a version control system (VCS). You can override this behavior by adding a [ci skip] or [skip ci] tag anywhere in a commitâ€™s title or description. 


## Trigger a Job Using curl and Your API Token

```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_API_USER_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=deploy_docker \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/<vcs-type>/<org>/<repo>/tree/<branch>
```

## Scheduled Builds 

```
workflows:
  version: 2
  commit:
    jobs:
      - test
      - deploy
  nightly:
    triggers: #use the triggers key to indicate a scheduled build
      - schedule:
          cron: "0 0 * * *" # use cron syntax to set the schedule
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - master
                - beta
    jobs:
      - coverage
```      

## Manual Approval

```
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-test-and-approval-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test1:
          requires:
            - build
      - test2:
          requires:
            - test1
      - hold:
          type: approval # requires that an in-app button be clicked by an appropriate member of the project to continue.
          requires:
           - test2
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - hold
```
