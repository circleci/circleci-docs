You can access the Arm VM (virtual machine) execution environment for a job by using the machine executor, specifying a Linux virtual machine image that includes Arm resources, and then specifying an Arm resource class.

[.tab.armblock.Cloud]

[,yaml]
----
# .circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2204:2023.07.1
    resource_class: arm.medium
    steps:
      - run: uname -a
      - run: echo "Hello, Arm!"

== Images with Arm support

Arm resources are accessible by using the machine executor when using one of the following images:

[#limitations]
== Limitations

* Some orbs that include an executable may *not* be compatible with Arm at
this time. If you run into issues with orbs on Arm, you can link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/arm-preview-docs/issues[open an issue].
* We currently do not provide support for 32-bit Arm architectures. Only 64-bit
`arm64` architectures are supported at this time.
* There may be up to 2 minutes of spin-up time before your job actually starts
running. This time will decrease as more customers start using Arm resources.
* If there is software you require that is not available in the image, you can
link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/arm-preview-docs/issues[open an issue] to
let us know.
* In CircleCI server, Arm resources are only available when using the EC2 provider
for VM service. This is because there are no Arm instances available in GCP.

[#m1-mac-support]
=== M1 Mac support

Docker images built on M1 Macs, are by default, not compatible with the CircleCI standard platform. The `spin up environment` job in your pipelines will give you a green tic, but you will see the following message in the response:

[,shell]
----
WARNING: docker image ghcr.io/{your_username}/runner-test:latest targets wrong architecture (found arm64 but need [amd64 i386 386])
----

If you build an image on an M1 you need to specify `docker build --platform linux/amd64` as the default builds `arm64`.
