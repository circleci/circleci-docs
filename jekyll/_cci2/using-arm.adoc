You can access the Arm VM (virtual machine) execution environment for a job by using the machine executor, specifying a Linux virtual machine image that includes Arm resources, and then specifying an Arm resource class.

[.tab.armblock.Cloud]
--
[,yaml]
----
# .circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  my-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2204:2023.07.1
    resource_class: arm.medium
    steps:
      - run: uname -a
      - run: echo "Hello, Arm!"

[.tab.armblock.Server]

# .circleci/config.yml

    machine:
      image: arm-default

== Images with Arm support

Arm resources are accessible by using the machine executor when using one of the following images:

For a full list of machine executor images, see the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=machine[CircleCI Developer Hub]. And for announcements about image updates, see link:https://discuss.circleci.com/c/ecosystem/circleci-images/64[CircleCI Discuss].

[#limitations]
== Limitations

* Only 64-bit `arm64` architectures are supported.
* In CircleCI server, Arm resources are only available when using the EC2 provider for VM service or machine provisioner. This is because there are no Arm instances available in GCP.
* If you run into issues with orbs, or if there is software you require that is not available in the image, link:https://circleci.canny.io/cloud-feature-requests[submit a feature request].

[#m1-mac-support]
=== M1 Mac support

Docker images built on M1 Macs, are by default, not compatible with the CircleCI standard platform. The `spin up environment` job in your pipelines will give you a green tic, but you will see the following message in the response:

[,shell]
----
WARNING: docker image ghcr.io/{your_username}/runner-test:latest targets wrong architecture (found arm64 but need [amd64 i386 386])
----

If you build an image on an M1 you need to specify `docker build --platform linux/amd64` as the default builds `arm64`.

[#arm-on-docker]
== Arm on Docker

For further information on using Arm with the Docker execution environment, see the xref:using-docker#arm[Using the Docker execution environment] page.
