== PostgreSQL

NOTE: If using your own PostgreSQL instance, it needs to be version 12.1 or higher. 

.External PostgreSQL

If you choose to use an external PostgreSQL instance, complete the following fields: 

* *PostgreSQL Service Domain (required)* - The domain or IP address of your PostgreSQL instance. 

* *PostgreSQL Service Port (required)* - The port of your PostgreSQL instance. 

* *PostgreSQL Service Username (required)* - A user with the appropriate privileges to access your PostgreSQL instance. 

* *PostgreSQL Service Password (required)* - The password of the user account used to access your PostgreSQL instance. 

=== Best Practices for your PostgreSQL

Consider running at least two PostgreSQL replicas to allow recovery from primary failure and for backups. The table below shows the recommended specifications for PostgreSQL machines:

=== Backing Up PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL provides official documentation for backing up and restoring your PostgreSQL 12 install, which can be found https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/backup.html[here].

We strongly recommend the following:

* Taking daily backups.
* Keeping at least 30 days of backups.
* Using encrypted storage for backups as databases might contain sensitive information.
* Performing a backup before each upgrade of CircleCI server.

== MongoDB

NOTE: If using your own MongoDB instance, it needs to be version 3.6 or higher. 

.External MongoDB

If you choose to use an external MongoDB instance, complete the following fields: 

* *MongoDB connection host(s) or IP(s) (required)* - 
The hostname or IP of your MongoDB instance. Specifying a port using a colon and multiple hosts for sharded instances are both supported.

* *Use SSL for connection to MongoDB (required)* - 
Whether to use SSL when connecting to your external MongoDB instance.

* *Allow insecure TLS connections (required)* - 
If you use a self-signed certificate or one signed by a custom CA, you will need to enable this setting. However, this is an insecure setting and you should use a TLS certificate signed by a valid CA, if you can.

* *MongoDB user (required)* - 
The username for the account to use. This account should have the dbAdmin role.

* *MongoDB password (required)* - 
The password for the account to use.

* *MongoDB authentication source database (required)* - 
The database that holds the account information, usually admin.

* *MongoDB authentication mechanism (required)* - 
The authentication mechanism to use, usually SCRAM-SHA-1.

* *Additional connection options (optional)* - 
Any other connection options you would like to use. This needs to be formatted as a query string (`key=value` pairs, separated by `&`. Special characters must be URL encoded). See the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/reference/connection-string/[MongoDB docs] for available options.

== Vault

.External Vault

* *URL* - The URL to your Vault service.

* *Transit Path* - Your Vault secrets transit path.

* *Token* - The access token for vault.
