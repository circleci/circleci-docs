= Sample config.yml Files
:description: Sample config.yml File
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs


This document provides sample `.circleci/config.yml` files that you can use as a starting point when setting up projects, or to better understand different ways to orchestrate jobs using workflows and filters. For information on all configuration elements available to you, see the xref:configuration-reference#[Configuration reference] page.

If you would like to get set up quickly, see our language-specific quickstart guides:

* xref:language-javascript#[Node]
* xref:language-python#[Python]
* xref:language-go#[Go]

== Tools for editing configuration files

CircleCI has created an xref:vs-code-extension-overview#[extension for Visual Studio Code] that reduces context switching between the web app and VS Code through a set of helpful features.

The VS Code extension reduces the time to create, modify, and troubleshoot configuration files through real-time syntax validation, highlighting, and autocomplete suggestions. Authenticating the extension with your CircleCI account will also allow you to visualize and manage your CircleCI pipelines directly from your code editor, and be notified of workflow status changes.

The CircleCI VS Code extension is available to download on the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circleci.circleci[VS Code marketplace].

[#concurrent-workflow]
=== Concurrent workflow

The configuration example below shows a concurrent workflow in which the `build` and `test` jobs run at the same time. Both jobs are run in Docker containers using the base image provided by CircleCI.

* Refer to the xref:workflows#[Workflows] document for complete details about orchestrating job runs with concurrent, sequential, and manual approval workflows.
* Refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=docker[Developer Hub convenience images] page to find out about available Docker images for running your jobs.

This image shows the workflow view for the following configuration example:

# Orchestrate our job run sequence
workflows:
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
----

[#sequential-workflow]
=== Sequential workflow

The configuration example below shows a sequential workflow where the `build` job runs, and then the `test` job runs once `build` has completed. Configure sequential workflows using the xref:configuration-reference#requires[`requires` key], and specifying the `test` job "requires" the `build` job in order to run. Both jobs are run in Docker containers using the base image provided by CircleCI.

* Refer to the xref:workflows#[Workflows] document for complete details about orchestrating job runs with concurrent, sequential, and manual approval workflows.
* Refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/images?imageType=docker[developer hub convenience images] page to find out about available Docker images for running your jobs.

This image shows the workflow view for the following configuration example, in which jobs run sequentially (one after the other):

    docker:

[#approval-job]
=== Approval job

The example below shows a sequential workflow with an xref:configuration-reference#type[approval job]. Use an approval job to require manual approval before downstream jobs may proceed.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

executors: # Define an executor
  my-executor:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2024.01
# Define the jobs we want to run for this project
jobs:
  build:
    executor: my-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "build"
  test:
    executor: my-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "test"
  deploy:
    executor: my-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "deploy"

# Orchestrate our job run sequence
workflows:
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test:
          requires:
            - build
      - hold:
          type: approval
          requires:
            - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - hold
----

The workflow runs as follows:

. `build` job runs
. `test` job runs
. `hold` job, with `type: approval` ensures the workflow waits for manual approval in the CircleCI web app
. Once `hold` job is approved the `deploy` job runs

An approval job can have any name. In the example above the approval job is named `hold`. The name you choose for an approval job should not be used to define a job in the main configuration. An approval job only exists as a workflow orchestration devise.

The image below shows the workflow view for the following configuration example. This image has three parts to show:

* The workflow graph with the `hold` job paused
* The "Needs Approval" popup that appears when you click on a hold job
* The workflow view again once the `hold` job has been approved and the `deploy` job has run

NOTE: A job can only run when its dependencies are satisfied therefore it requires the dependencies of all upstream jobs. This means only the immediate upstream dependencies need to be specified in the `requires:` blocks.

[#sample-configuration-with-multiple-executor-types]
== Sample configuration with multiple executor types

It is possible to use multiple xref:executor-intro#[executor types]
in the same workflow.

In `Example-1` each push will build and test the project on Linux, Windows and macOS.

In `Example-2` each push of an iOS project will be built on macOS, and additional iOS tools (link:https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint[SwiftLint] and link:https://github.com/danger/danger[Danger]) will be run in Docker.
