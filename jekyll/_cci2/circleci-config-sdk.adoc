[#overview]
== Overview

The link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-config-sdk-ts[CircleCI Config SDK] is a JavaScript package library (also compatible with TypeScript) for generating a CircleCI YAML configuration file. Use the SDK to:

* Replace writing YAML configuration files
* Generate a static YAML configuration file
* Modularize and manage your configuration as JavaScript packages
* Enhance CircleCI's <<using-dynamic-configuration#,dynamic configuration>>
* Build integrations with CLI tools or browser-based experiences

For example, generating a static configuration file can be useful for CLI tools where you want to create a CircleCI configuration, or browser-based tooling, such as a link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/visual-config-editor/[visual config editor].

Components created with the CircleCI Config SDK can be packaged and distributed as Node packages.
