== Introduction
This page outlines how to stop builds for a project on CircleCI, and how to delete a project when required.

[#stop-building-a-project]
== Stop building a project

CAUTION: The **Stop Building** option will not automatically remove all project data from the CircleCI databases. To remove all project data from CircleCI you need to contact CircleCI support, as detailed in the <<remove-a-project-from-circleci>> section.

include::../_includes/partials/notes/standalone-unsupported.adoc[This feature is not supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center]

If you are using the GitHub OAuth App or Bitbucket Cloud, to stop building one of your projects on CircleCI, follow these steps:

. Go to the **Project Settings** page in the CircleCI web app for the project you want to stop.
. Scroll to the bottom of the Overview page and select **Stop Building**. You will need to reconfirm your choice in the popup.

NOTE: If you want to start building this project again, just go to the **Projects** page in the web app and select **Set Up Project** and follow the set up steps.

[#remove-a-project-from-circleci]
== Delete a project from CircleCI

If you want to remove a project from your CircleCI account, follow the steps below. Deleting a project will remove the complete build history. Only organization admins and project admins can delete projects. 

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/home/[CircleCI web app], select the organization associated with the project you want to remove.
. Select the project you want to remove from the project cards. If you do not see your project, select **Projects** in the sidebar and find it in the list.
. Select **Project Settings** (or the ellipsis next to your project (icon:ellipsis-h[]) and then select **Project Settings**).
. Scroll to the bottom of the Overview page and select **Delete Project** and reconfirm your choice in the popup.  


If you encounter an error, open a new link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[support request] with details of the project that you wish to remove. Choose the "Build Failure/Configuration Help/Service Issue" option when opening the request.
