[#introduction]
== Introduction
This page outlines how to stop builds for a project on CircleCI, and how to delete a project when required.

[#stop-building-a-project]
== Stop building a project

CAUTION: The **Stop Building** option will not automatically remove all project data from the CircleCI databases. To remove all project data from CircleCI you need to contact CircleCI support, as detailed in the <<remove-a-project-from-circleci>> section.

NOTE: The **Stop Building** option is supported for GitHub OAuth and Bitbucket Cloud integrations with CircleCI. **Stop Building** is not supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center projects. To find out if you authorized through the GitHub OAuth app or the CircleCI GitHub App, see the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

If you are using the GitHub OAuth App or Bitbucket Cloud, to stop building one of your projects on CircleCI, follow these steps:

. Go to the **Project Settings** page in the CircleCI web app for the project you want to stop.
. Scroll to the bottom of the Overview page and select **Stop Building**. You will need to reconfirm your choice in the popup.

NOTE: If you want to start building this project again, just go to the **Projects** page in the web app and select **Set Up Project** and follow the set up steps.

[#remove-a-project-from-circleci]

If you want to remove a project from your CircleCI account, follow the steps below. Deleting a project will remove the complete build history. Project deletion requests must be submitted or approved by an organization admin.

. Follow the instructions for your VCS integration to unlink the project from your account.
