CAUTION: The **Stop Building** option will not automatically remove all project data from the CircleCI databases. To remove all project data from CircleCI you need to contact CircleCI support, as detailed in the <<remove-a-project-from-circleci>> section.

To stop building one of your projects on CircleCI, follow these steps:

. Go to the **Project Settings** page in the CircleCI web app for the project you want to stop.
. Scroll to the bottom of the Overview page and click **Stop Building**. You will need to reconfirm your choice in the popup.

NOTE: If you want to start building this project again, just go to the **Projects** page in the web app and click **Set Up Project** and follow the set up steps.
