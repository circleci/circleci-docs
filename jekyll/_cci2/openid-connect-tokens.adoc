:page-description: Learn how to use OpenID Connect ID tokens for access to compatible cloud services.
:icons: font
:experimental:

CircleCI provides OpenID Connect ID (OIDC) tokens in environment variables. A job can be configured to use these tokens to access compatible cloud services without long-lived credentials being stored in CircleCI.

[#openid-connect-id-token-availability]
== OpenID Connect ID token availability

CircleCI OpenID Connect ID tokens are available in the following environment variables:

* `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN`
* `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_V2` - Includes a different format for the `sub` claim, See <<format-of-the-openid-connect-id-token>> for full details.

CAUTION: **What about forks?** OIDC tokens will only be generated for forked builds if the **Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests** setting is enabled. Find this option at **Project settings** > **Advanced**. See <<oidc-in-open-source-projects>>.

[#setting-up-your-cloud-service]
== Setting up your cloud service

Refer to the documentation for your target cloud service for steps to add an identity provider. For example, AWS's https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers], or Google Cloud Platform's https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workload-identity-federation#oidc[Configuring workload identity federation].

The https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology[OpenID Provider] is unique to your organization. The URL is `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>`, where `organization_id` is the organization ID (a universally unique identifier) that represents your organization. You can find your CircleCI organization ID by navigating to **Organization Settings > Overview** in the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app].

The OpenID Connect ID tokens issued by CircleCI have a fixed audience (see `aud` in the table below), which is also the organization ID.

NOTE: It is possible to use CircleCI's OIDC tokens with multiple cloud services.

[#format-of-the-openid-connect-id-token]
== Format of the OpenID Connect ID token

The OIDC tokens contain the following standard https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[claims]:

[%autowidth]
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Claims
| Description

| `iss`
| The issuer. The issuer is specific to the CircleCI organization in which the job is being run. Its value is `"https://oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>"`, a string, where `organization_id` is a UUID identifying the current job's project's organization.

| `sub`
a| The subject. This identifies who is running the CircleCI job and where. `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_V2` also includes information about the source of change.

For `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN` its value is: `"org/<organization_id>/project/<project_id>/user/<user_id>"`, a string, where `organization_id`, `project_id`, and `user_id` are UUIDs that identify the CircleCI organization, project, and user, respectively. The user is the CircleCI user that caused this job to run.

For `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_V2` its value is: `"org/<organization_id>/project/<project_id>/user/<user_id>/vcs-origin/<vcs_origin>/vcs-ref/<vcs_ref>"`, a string, where `organization_id`, `project_id`, and `user_id` are UUIDs that identify the CircleCI organization, project, and user, respectively. The user is the CircleCI user that caused this job to run. `vcs_origin` and `vcs_ref` are strings that identify the repo URL and reference to the change that caused the job to run.

| `aud`
| The audience. Currently, this is a fixed value `"ORGANIZATION_ID"`, a string containing a UUID that identifies the job's project's organization.

| `iat`
| The time of issuance. This is the time the token was created, which is shortly before the job starts.

| `exp`
| The expiration time. Its value is one hour after the time of issuance.
|===


The OpenID Connect ID tokens also contain some https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AdditionalClaims[additional claims] with extra metadata about the job:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Additional claims
| Metadata

| `oidc.circleci.com/project-id`
| The ID of the project in which the job is running. Its value is a string containing a UUID identifying the CircleCI project.

| `oidc.circleci.com/vcs-origin`
| The URL of the repo that triggered the pipeline. Its value is a string similar to `github.com/organization-123/repo-1`.

| `oidc.circleci.com/vcs-ref`
| The reference to the change that triggered the pipeline. Its value is a string similar to `refs/heads/main`.

| `oidc.circleci.com/context-ids`
| An array of strings containing UUIDs that identify the context(s) used in the job. Currently, just one context is supported.

| `oidc.circleci.com/ssh-rerun`
| A boolean indicating if the CI job is started using the SSH rerun feature.
|===

[#oidc-in-open-source-projects]
== OIDC in open source projects

OIDC tokens will only be generated for forked builds if the **Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests** setting is enabled. Find this option at **Project settings** > **Advanced**.

If you do allow OIDC tokens to be generated for forks, you **must** check the `oidc.circleci.com/vcs-origin` claims in your policies to avoid forked builds having access to resources outside those that you require.

For more information about building open source projects on CircleCI, see the xref:oss#[Build open source projects] page.

[#authenticate-jobs-with-cloud-providers]
==  Authenticate jobs with cloud providers

The following sections describe how to authenticate CircleCI jobs with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

=== AWS

The following AWS instructions cover the following:

* A one-time configuration of your AWS account to trust CircleCI's OIDC tokens
* Running a job that uses the OIDC token to interact with AWS

Also see the xref:pull-an-image-from-aws-ecr-with-oidc#[Pull an image from AWS ECR with OIDC] how-to guide, which follows on from this setup section.

[#set-up-aws]
==== Set up AWS

You will need to allow your AWS account to trust CircleCI's OpenID Connect tokens. To do this, create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity provider, and an IAM role in AWS. Creating the identity provider is a one-time configuration to get set up, and then you can decide how to manage the associated role(s). You can update the role permissions, using policies, to fit your use cases, or you can create roles specific to each use.

. Visit the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers] page of the AWS docs and follow the instructions. There are multiple setup options covered on this page, including using the management console, or CLI. You will need to provide the following:
** **Provider URL**: Enter `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/<your-organization-id>`, where `your-organization-id` is the ID of your CircleCI organization.
** **Audience**: Enter your organization ID
+
{% include snippets/find-organization-id.adoc %}

. Once your have created your identity provider, a banner will appear at the top of the ADW console with the options to **Assign role**. Click this button to create a new role, or visit the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create[Creating a role for web identity or OIDC] section of the AWS docs and follow the steps there. You will need to select the following:
+
** The **Identity Provider** that you just created.
** For **Audience**, choose the only option, which is your organization ID that you entered earlier.
** On the **Add Permissions** page you can specify what your CircleCI jobs _can_ and _cannot_ do. Choose only permissions that your job will need. This is an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege[AWS best practice]. You can also write your own policies to lock down permissions to exactly what you need for a specific use case.

[#adding-aws-to-the-circleci-configuration-file]
==== Adding AWS to the CircleCI configuration file

Now that you have set up your trusted identity provider and IAM role, you are ready to write a CircleCI job that authenticates with AWS using OIDC. This is accomplished using CircleCIâ€™s link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-cli[AWS CLI orb] to generate temporary keys and configure a profile that uses OIDC.

TIP: Orbs are reusable packages of YAML configuration that condense repeated pieces of configuration into a single line of code. In this case, the AWS CLI orb enables you to generate a temporary session token, AWS Access Key ID, and AWS secret access key with a single command in your configuration.

. In your `.circleci/config`, import the `aws-cli` orb.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@3.1.5
----

. Configure your job to run the `aws-cli/setup` command before interacting with any AWS services. You will need to provide the `aws-cli/setup` command with the `role-arn` associated with the role you have created in the step above along with your `aws-region`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  aws-example:
    environment:
      AWS_REGION: us-west-1
    docker:
      - image: cimg/aws:2023.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      # run the aws-cli/setup command from the orb
      - aws-cli/setup:
          role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/OIDC-ROLE"
          aws-region: ${AWS_REGION}
          # optional parameters
          profile-name: "OIDC-PROFILE"
          role-session-name: "example-session"
          session-duration: "1800"
----
+
You can optionally provide a `profile-name`, `role-session-name`, and `session-duration`. If you provide a `profile-name`, the temporary keys and token will be configured to that specific profile. You must use that same `profile-name` with the rest of your aws commands. If a `profile-name` is not provided, the keys and token will be configured to the default profile.
+
Additionally, if you do not provide a `role-session-name` or `session-duration`, their default values are `${CIRCLE_JOB}` (your jobâ€™s name) and 3600 seconds respectively.

Below is an example of a complete configuration with a job that configures a profile with OIDC and uses it to log into AWS ECR. The same profile can be used to run other AWS commands, such as S3, EKS, ECS, and more, as long as the `role-arn` has been configured with appropriate permissions.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@3.1.5

jobs:
  aws-example:
   environment:
      AWS_REGION: us-west-1
    docker:
      - image: cimg/aws:2022.06
    steps:
      - checkout
      # run the aws-cli/setup command from the orb
      - aws-cli/setup:
          role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/OIDC-ROLE"
          aws-region: AWS_REGION
          # optional parameters
          profile-name: "OIDC-PROFILE"
          role-session-name: "example-session"
          session-duration: "1800"
      - run:
        name: Log-into-AWS-ECR
        command: |
          # must use same profile specified in the step above
          aws ecr get-login-password --profile "OIDC-PROFILE"
workflows:

    jobs:
      - aws-example:
          context: aws
```

[#advanced-usage]
==== Advanced Usage

You can take advantage of the format of the claims in CircleCI's <<format-of-the-openid-connect-id-token,OIDC token>> to limit what your CircleCI jobs can do in AWS.

[#limit-role-access-based-on-project]
===== Limit role access based on project

If certain projects should only be able to access certain AWS resources, you can restrict your IAM role so that only CircleCI jobs in a specific project can assume that role.

To do this, edit your IAM role's trust policy so that only an OIDC token from your chosen project can assume that role. The trust policy determines under what conditions the role can be assumed.

. Go to an individual project's page in the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] and navigate to **Project Settings > Overview** to find your Project ID.

. Add the following condition to your role's trust policy, so that only jobs in your chosen project can assume that role. Enter your Organization ID for `organization_id` and your Project ID for `project_id`.
+
```yaml
"StringLike": {
  "oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>:sub": "org/<organization_id>/project/<project_id>/user/*"
}
```
+
This uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_String[StringLike] to match the sub claim of CircleCI's OIDC token in your chosen project. Now, jobs in your other projects cannot assume this role.

[#limit-role-access-based-on-branch]
===== Limit role access based on branch

You can also restrict access to specific branches. The following is an example of a trust policy that restricts the `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` action to any project pipelines running only on the `main` branch in the `my-org` GitHub organization and the CircleCI organization with the ID: `organization_id`. Note that the `sub` claim uses the `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_V2` format.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>:sub": "org/<organization_id>/project/*/user/*/vcs-origin/github.com/my-org/*/vcs-ref/refs/heads/main"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

[#google-cloud-platform]
=== Google Cloud Platform

The following GCP instructions are for:

* A one-time configuration of your GCP settings to trust CircleCI's OIDC tokens
* Running a job that uses the OIDC token to interact with GCP

The Google Cloud CLI reads your configuration file, which contains necessary information instructing Google Cloud to authenticate. You can read about external identity providers on https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workload-identity-federation#oidc[Google Cloud's docs].

[#setting-up-gcp]
==== Setting up GCP

The GCP configuration file can be set up using the GCP web UI. In the **Workload Identity Federation UI**, navigate to **Grant Access**, which will prompt the configuration, which can then be downloaded. You will need to create a file named `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE`, which Google Cloud will read your identity token from (the file name can be anything, as long as it matches what is in the configuration under `credential_source`).

You will need your CircleCI organization ID, which can be found by navigating to **Organization Settings > Overview** on the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app].

After navigating to the **Grant Access** section of the GCP web UI, follow these steps to add CircleCI as an external identity provider:

. Navigate to the **IAM & Admin panel**.
. On the side panel, navigate to **Workload Identity Federation**.
. Click the **Add Provider** button.
. Select **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** from the "Select a provider" dropdown and click **Save**.
. Fill out the **Provider details** form.
  * Select **Allowed audiences** since the `aud` claim in the JSON Web Token is a UUID (your CircleCI organization ID). The `audience` will be your CircleCI organization ID.
  * The issuer is `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/<organization_id>`, where `organization_id` is your CircleCI organization ID.
. Click **Continue** to configure provider attributes.
+
Configuring the provider attributes provides an opportunity to map claims in CircleCI's Token to Google's "understanding". Use this mapping:
+
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, stripes=even]

|===
| google.subject
| assertion.sub

| attribute.org_id 
| assertion.aud

| attribute.project
| assertion['oidc.circleci.com/project-id']
|===
+
. Navigate to **Service Account** in the IAM & Admin Panel to create a service account, and give appropriate permission.
. Navigate back to **Workload Identity Federation** and select the provider from the table.
. Click the **Grant access** button.
. A modal will open and you will select the service account you created from the dropdown. This is the account that the token will impersonate, which grants all the associated permissions.
. Under **Select principals**, you can add conditions, or leave the default.
. Click **Save**. A pop-up will appear to ask you configure and **download** the configuration file. This file can also be downloaded later by navigating to **Connected Service Accounts**.
. Save the downloaded configuration file in your repo. This file will be referenced in your CircleCI configuration.

An example of the configuration file is shown below. Note, the `audience` has not been set up yet with the following:

* `project_number` (the unique identifying number generated for your project)
* `pool_id` (an ID that references the workload identity pool, for example `circleci_oidc`)
* `provider_id` (an ID that references the workload identity pool provider, for example, `circleci`)

```yaml
 {
  "type": "external_account",
  "audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/<project_number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<pool_id>/providers/<provider_id>",
  "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt",
  "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
  "service_account_impersonation_url": "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/circleci-test@incubator-344312.iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateAccessToken",
  "credential_source": {
    "file": "CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE",
    "format": {
      "type": "text"
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration, `credential_source` will attempt to find your identity token in the `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE`, as noted in the (<<#openid-connect-id-token-availability,token availability>> section).

If your token comes from an API response, it might be useful to set up the configuration to read a JSON file. In this case, the `type` will need to be set to `json` and you will need to provide a valid `path`, for example, `response.id_token`.

```yaml
  "credential_source": {
    "file": "CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE",
    "format": {
      "type": "json",
      "path": "response.id_token"
    }
  }
```

Please note, if needed, you can also attempt to generate the GCP configuration file by running the following script:

```shell
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
  "${GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_AUDIENCE}" \
  --output-file="${GCP_CREDENTIAL_CONFIGURATION_FILE}" \
  --service-account="${GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --credential-source-file="${GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE_FILE}"
```
[#adding-gcp-to-the-circleci-configuration-file]
==== Adding GCP to the CircleCI configuration file

You will need to export the `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN` to the file named `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE` by running the following:

```bash
echo $CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN >> CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE
```

You will also need to add the following environment variables to a <<contexts#,context>>.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, stripes=even]
