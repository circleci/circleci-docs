## Overview
{:.no_toc}

To add private keys or secret environment variables to your private project, use the Environment Variables page of the Build > Project > Settings in the CircleCI application. The value of the variables are neither readable nor editable in the app after they are set. To change the value of an environment variable, delete the current variable and add it again with the new value. It is possible to add individual variables or to import variables from another project. Private environment variables enable you to store secrets safely even when your project is public, see [Building Open Source Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/oss/) for associated settings information.

### Environment Variable Usage Options
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI uses Bash,
which follows the POSIX naming convention for environment variables.
Valid characters include letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and the underscore.
The first character of each environment variable must be a letter.

Secrets and private keys that are securely stored in the CircleCI app may be referenced with the variable in a `run` key, `environment` key, or a Workflows `context` key in your configuration. Environment variables are used according to a specific precedence order, as follows:

1. Environment variables declared [inside a shell command](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-shell-command) in a `run` step, for example `FOO=bar make install`.
2. Environment variables declared with the `environment` key [for a `run` step](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-step).
3. Environment variables set with the `environment` key [for a job](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-job).
4. Environment variables set with the `environment` key [for a container](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-container).
5. Context environment variables (assuming the user has access to the Context). See the [Contexts]( {{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/contexts/) documentation for instructions.
6. [Project-level environment variables](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) set on the Project Settings page.
7. Special CircleCI environment variables defined in the [CircleCI Built-in Environment Variables](#built-in-environment-variables) section of this document.

Environment variables declared inside a shell command `run step`, for example `FOO=bar make install`, will override environment variables declared with the `environment` and `contexts` keys. Environment variables added on the Contexts page will take precedence over variables added on the Project Settings page. Finally, special CircleCI environment variables are loaded.

**Note**:
Do not add secrets or keys inside the `.circleci/config.yml` file.
The full text of `config.yml` is visible
to developers with access to your project on CircleCI.
Store secrets or keys in [project](#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) or [context]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/contexts/) settings in the CircleCI app.
For more information,
see the [Encryption section]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/security/#encryption) of the "Security" document.

Running scripts within configuration
may expose secret environment variables.
See the [Using Shell Scripts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/using-shell-scripts/#shell-script-best-practices) document for best practices for secure scripts.

### Using `BASH_ENV` to Set Environment Variables
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI does not support interpolation
when setting environment variables.
All defined values are treated literally.
This can cause issues
when defining `working_directory`,
modifying `PATH`,
and sharing variables across multiple `run` steps.

In the example below,
`$ORGNAME` and `$REPONAME` will not be interpolated.

```yaml
working_directory: /go/src/github.com/$ORGNAME/$REPONAME
```

As a workaround,
use a `run` step
to export environment variables to `BASH_ENV`,
as shown below.

```yaml
steps:
  - run:
      name: Setup Environment Variables
      command: |
        echo 'export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"' >> $BASH_ENV
        echo 'export GIT_SHA1="$CIRCLE_SHA1"' >> $BASH_ENV
```

In every step,
CircleCI uses `bash` to source `BASH_ENV`.
This means that
`BASH_ENV` is automatically loaded and run,
allowing you to use interpolation
and share environment variables across `run` steps.

**Note:**
The `BASH_ENV` workaround only works with `bash`.
Other implementations like `sh` will not work.
This limitation affects your image options.
For example,
because [Alpine images](https://alpinelinux.org/) do not include `bash` by default,
the `BASH_ENV` workaround will not work
without first installing `bash`.

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Shell Command

CircleCI does not support interpolation
when setting environment variables.

However,
it is possible
to set variables for the current shell
by [using `BASH_ENV`](#using-bash_env-to-set-environment-variables).
This is useful
for both modifying your `PATH`
and setting environment variables
that reference other variables.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: smaant/lein-flyway:2.7.1-4.0.3
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Update PATH and Define Environment Variable at Runtime
          command: |
            echo 'export PATH=/path/to/foo/bin:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
            echo 'export VERY_IMPORTANT=$(cat important_value)' >> $BASH_ENV
            source $BASH_ENV
```

**Note**:
Depending on your shell,
you may have to append the new variable to a shell startup file
like `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
For more information,
refer to your shell's documentation on setting environment variables.

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Step

To set an environment variable in a step,
use the [`environment` key]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#run).

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: smaant/lein-flyway:2.7.1-4.0.3
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run migrations
          command: sql/docker-entrypoint.sh sql
          # Environment variable for a single command shell
          environment:
            DATABASE_URL: postgres://conductor:@localhost:5432/conductor_test
```

**Note:**
Since every `run` step is a new shell,
environment variables are not shared across steps.
If you need an environment variable
to be accessible in more than one step,
export the value [using `BASH_ENV`](#using-bash_env-to-set-environment-variables).

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Job

To set an environment variable in a job,
use the [`environment` key]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#job_name).

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
    environment:
      FOO: bar
```

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Container

To set an environment variable in a container,
use the [`environment` key]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker--machine--macosexecutor).

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: smaant/lein-flyway:2.7.1-4.0.3
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6-jessie
      # environment variables for all commands executed in the primary container
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: conductor
          POSTGRES_DB: conductor_test
```

The following example shows separate environment variable settings for the primary container image (listed first) and the secondary or service container image.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.6.2-jessie
       # environment variables for all commands executed in the primary container
        environment:
          FLASK_CONFIG: testing
          TEST_DATABASE_URL: postgresql://ubuntu@localhost/circle_test?sslmode=disable
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6
```

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Context

Creating a context
allows you to share environment variables across multiple projects.
To set an environment variables in a context,
see the [Contexts documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/contexts/).

## Setting an Environment Variable in a Project

1. In the CircleCI application,
go to your project's settings
by clicking the gear icon next to your project.

2. In the **Build Settings** section,
click on **Environment Variables**.

3. Import variables from another project
by clicking the **Import Variable(s)** button.
Add new variables
by clicking the **Add Variable** button.
(**Note:** The **Import Variables(s)** button is not currently available on CircleCI installed in your private cloud or datacenter.)

4. Use your new environment variables in your `.circleci/config.yml` file.
For an example,
see the [Heroku deploy walkthrough]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/deployment-integrations/#heroku).

Once created,
environment variables are hidden and uneditable in the application.
Changing an environment variable is only possible
by deleting and recreating it.

### Encoding Multi-Line Environment Variables
{:.no_toc}

If you are having difficulty adding a multiline environment variable,
use `base64` to encode it.

```bash
$ echo "foobar" | base64
Zm9vYmFyCg==
```

Store the resulting value in a CircleCI environment variable.

```bash
$ echo $MYVAR
Zm9vYmFyCg==
```

Decode the variable in any commands
that use the variable.

```bash
$ echo $MYVAR | base64 --decode | docker login -u my_docker_user --password-stdin
Login Succeeded
```

**Note:**
Not all command-line programs take credentials
in the same way that `docker` does.

## Injecting Environment Variables with the API

Build parameters are environment variables, therefore their names have to meet the following restrictions:

- They must contain only ASCII letters, digits and the underscore character.
- They must not begin with a number.
- They must contain at least one character.

Aside from the usual constraints for environment variables there are no restrictions on the values themselves and are treated as simple strings. The order that build parameters are loaded in is **not** guaranteed so avoid interpolating one build parameter into another. It is best practice to set build parameters as an unordered list of independent environment variables.

For example, when you pass the parameters:

```
{
  "build_parameters": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": 5,
    "qux": {"quux": 1},
    "list": ["a", "list", "of", "strings"]
  }
}
```

Your build will see the environment variables:

```
export foo="bar"
export baz="5"
export qux="{\"quux\": 1}"
export list="[\"a\", \"list\", \"of\", \"strings\"]"
```

Build parameters are exported as environment variables inside each job's containers and can be used by scripts/programs and commands in `config.yml`. The injected environment variables may be used to influence the steps that are run during the job. It is important to note that injected environment variables will not override values defined in `config.yml` nor in the project settings.

You might want to inject environment variables with the `build_parameters` key to enable your functional tests to build against different targets on each run. For example, a run with a deploy step to a staging environment that requires functional testing against different hosts. It is possible to include `build_parameters` by sending a JSON body with `Content-type: application/json` as in the following example that uses `bash` and `curl` (though you may also use an HTTP library in your language of choice).

```
{
  "build_parameters": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": 500
  }
}
```

For example using `curl`

```
curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"build_parameters": {"param1": "value1", "param2": 500}}' \
  --request POST \
  https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/circleci/mongofinil/tree/master?circle-token=$CIRCLE_TOKEN
```

In the above example,
`$CIRCLE_TOKEN` is a [personal API token]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token).

The build will see the environment variables:

```
export param1="value1"
export param2="500"
```

Start a run with the POST API call, see the [new build]( {{ site.baseurl }}/api/v1-reference/#new-build) section of the API documentation for details. A POST with an empty body will start a new run of the named branch.

## Built-in Environment Variables

The following environment variables are exported in each build
and can be used for more complex testing or deployment.

**Note:**
You cannot use a built-in environment variable
to define another environment variable.
Instead,
you must use a `run` step
to export the new environment variables using `BASH_ENV`.
