Use orbs to:

* Simplify CI/CD configuration.
* Automate repeated CI/CD processes.
* Accelerate project setup.
* Simplify integration with third-party tools.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Orbs are reusable packages of parameterizable configuration that can be used in any project. They are made up of reusable configuration elements, for example:
* xref:reusing-config#authoring-parameterized-jobs[jobs]
* xref:reusing-config#authoring-reusable-commands[commands]
* xref:reusing-config#executor[executors].

CircleCI supports two types of orbs:

*Registry orbs*:: Orbs that are developed and published using the orb publishing process. SemVer-based versioning is used to manage the versions of registry orbs. Registry orbs are available from the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orbs Registry]
*URL orbs*:: Orbs that are stored in a publicly accessible location (for example, a git repository or a public S3 object) and are not published to the orbs registry. URL orbs do not follow semantic versioning, and can be accessed directly using an `https` URL. An org-level allow list is used to manage the addresses of URL orbs that can be used in a project in that organization. Manage the allow list at menu:Organization Settings[Orbs]. See the xref:managing-url-orbs-allow-lists#[Managing URL orb allow-lists] guide for more information on scoping allowed URL orbs for your organization.

Orbs are available for many languages, platforms, services, and tools. Visit the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orbs Registry] to search for orbs to help simplify your configuration.

If you would like to author your own orb, read more on the xref:orb-author#[Introduction to Authoring Orbs] page.

[#use-an-orb]
== Use a registry orb

A registry orb is identified by its _slug_ which contains the _namespace_, and _orb name_. A namespace is a unique identifier referring to the organization authoring a set of orbs. The orb name will be followed by an `@` symbol and a xref:orb-concepts#semantic-versioning[semantic version] string, identifying which version of the orb is being used. For example: `<namespace>/<orb-name>@1.2.3`.

Each orb within the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[registry] provides a link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node#quick-start[quickstart guide], which contains a sample code snippet for importing that specific orb, with its most recent version, into your `.circleci/config.yml`.

The example below shows how to import any orb into your CircleCI configuration file. Use the tabs to switch between a generic layout for importing any orb, and a specific example of importing the Node.JS orb:

[.tab.nodeExample.Node]
--
[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  node: circleci/node@5.0.3
----
--

[.tab.nodeExample.Generic]
--
[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  <orb-name>: <namespace>/<orb-name>@x.y.z
----
--

After the orb has been imported into the configuration file, the elements provided by the orb are available as `<orb-name>/<element>`. Orb elements can include jobs, commands, and executors. The parameters available for each element are listed in the orb registry in a table under each element.

Most orbs will also include usage examples detailing common functionality, to further simplify the process of incorporating them into your projects. If you would like to contribute to an existing orb, or file an issue on the orb's repository, many orb authors will include the git repository link.

Orb elements can be used in the same way as xref:reusing-config#[reusable configuration] elements. The Node example below shows how to use an orb's default executor, and an orb command.

[#node-example]
=== Node example

The Node orb provides a command, link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node#commands-install-packages[`install-packages`], to install your node packages, automatically enable caching, and provide additional options through the use of parameters. To use the `install-packages` command, reference it in a job's xref:configuration-reference#steps[steps].

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  node: circleci/node@x.y # replace orb version

jobs:
  test:
    executor: node/default # use the default executor specified by the orb
    steps:
      - checkout
      - node/install-packages # Use a command from the orb in a job's steps
----

== Use a URL orb

To use a URL orb in your configuration, add the orb to the `orbs` section of your configuration file using the `https` URL of the orb repository. The URL must point to a repository that is accessible to CircleCI and must be allowed by the organization's allow list.

The following example shows how to import a URL orb named `platform` into your configuration file. To use this orb, the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my-org/` prefix must exist in your org's allow list.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  platform: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my-org/orbs/refs/heads/main/platform-team.yaml
----

After the orb has been imported into the configuration file, the elements provided by the orb are available as `<orb-name>/<element>`. Orb elements can include jobs, commands, and executors.

[#benefits-of-using-orbs]
== Benefits of using orbs

Orbs provide parameterizable configuration elements that can greatly simplify your configuration. To illustrate this, the following example shows the following:

* A typical configuration for testing a Node.js application using the Node.JS orb (using the `test` job provided by the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node[`circleci/node`] orb).
* Configuration required without using the orb (defining a job with the required steps for testing the application).

Orbs let you pull in pre-defined, parameterized configuration elements into your project configuration. Taking it a step further, authoring your own orb lets you define parameterized configuration elements once and utilize them across multiple similar projects.

[.tab.nodeTest.With_Orbs]

  node: circleci/node@x.y # replace orb version https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node#quick-start

  test_my_app:
    jobs:
      - node/test:
          version: <node-version> # replace node version

[.tab.nodeTest.Without_orbs]

      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - node-deps-v1-{{ .Branch }}-{{checksum "package-lock.json"}}
      - run:
          name: install packages
          command: npm ci
      - save_cache:
          key: node-deps-v1-{{ .Branch }}-{{checksum "package-lock.json"}}
          paths:
            - ~/.npm
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: npm run test

[#the-orb-registry]
== The orb registry

The link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs[Orb Registry] is an open repository of all published orbs. Find the orb for your stack or consider developing and xref:orb-author#[publishing your own orb].

[#orb-designation]
=== Registry orb designations

CAUTION: In order to use uncertified registry orbs (partner or community), your organization's administrator must opt-in to allow uncertified orb usage on the menu:Organization Settings[Security] page for your org.

Orbs in the registry will appear with one of three different namespace designations:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Designation | Description

| Certified
| Written and tested by the CircleCI team

| Partner
| Written by our technology partners

| Community
| Written by the community
|===

[#public-or-private]
=== Public or private

Orbs can be published in one of two ways:

* *Public*: Searchable in the orb registry, and available for anyone to use
* *Private*: Only available to use within your organization, and only findable in the registry with a direct URL and when authenticated

To understand these concepts further, read the xref:orb-concepts#private-orbs-vs-public-orbs[Public Orbs vs Private Orbs] section of the Orb Concepts page.

[#orbs-view]
== Orbs page in the CircleCI app

NOTE: The orbs page in the CircleCI web app is not currently available on CircleCI server.

NOTE: Private orb details pages may only be viewed by logged-in members of your organization. Unpublished orbs will not have linked details pages.

To access the orbs page in the web app, navigate to *Organization Settings* and select *Orbs* from the sidebar.

The orbs page lists orbs created within your organization. You can view:

* Orb type (public or private)
* Orb usage (how many times the orb is used across all configurations)
* Latest version
* Description

Full orb details, including orb source, are accessible by clicking on the orb name. The orb details page is similar to the CircleCI orb registry in that the details page provides the orb's contents, commands, and usage examples.

The orbs page also includes your org's allow list URLs for URL orbs.
