:description: Best practices for building open source projects
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs


This document provides tips and best practices for building your open source project on CircleCI.

== Credits for open source projects

See the xref:credits#open-source-credit-usage[Using Credits] page for up-to-date information on free credits available for open source projects

[#security]
== Security

While open source can be a liberating practice, take care not to liberate sensitive information.

* If your repository is public, your CircleCI project and its build logs are also public. Pay attention to the information you choose to print.
* Environment variables set in the CircleCI application are hidden from the public, these variables will not be shared in <<pass-secrets-to-builds-from-forked-pull-requests,forked PRs>>
unless explicitly enabled.

[#features-and-settings-for-open-source-projects]
== Features and settings for open source projects

The following features and settings can be useful for open source projects.

[#private-environment-variables]
=== Private environment variables

Many projects require API tokens, SSH keys, or passwords. Private environment variables allow you to safely store secrets, even if your project is public.

For more information, see the xref:set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[Set an environment variable] document.

[#only-build-pull-requests]
=== Only build pull requests

Open source projects have significantly more commits than private projects, so building every commit from every branch might be excessive and costly (both in terms of time and credits usage).

You can modify this behaviour by restricting builds to branches that have pull requests.

NOTE: This feature *is not supported* for orgs that use the Bitbucket Data Center integration.

. In the sidebar, click *Triggers*.
. Edit an existing GitHub App trigger or add a new GitHub App trigger.
. In the *Run on* dropdown list, select *PR opened or pushed to, default branch pushes, tag pushes*.

. In the sidebar, click *Advanced*
. Enable the *Only build pull requests* option.

image::triggers/advanced-only-build-prs.png[Enable the Only build pull requests option]

The ability to override the *Only build pull requests* setting is also supported. Specifically, CircleCI will run validation on all commits from additional, non-default branches that are specified via regular expression (for example, `release.\*`).

Override the *Only build pull requests* setting by utilizing the API and following the steps outlined in this link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/15222074173723-How-to-allowlist-additional-branches-for-Only-Build-Pull-Requests[support article].

Enabling *Only build pull requests* may result in duplicate builds. You can find troubleshooting steps in this link:https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013353748-Troubleshooting-duplicate-builds-triggered-upon-every-commit-push[support article].



NOTE: CircleCI will always build all commits from your project's _default branch and tags_ regardless of any setting.

NOTE: Although the Add/Edit Trigger pages in GitLab Cloud and GitLab self-managed slightly differ, the following steps apply to both integrations.

include::../_includes/partials/app-navigation/steps-to-project-settings.adoc[Insert steps from selecting an organization up to the Project Settings page]

. In the sidebar, click *Triggers*.
. Edit an existing GitLab trigger or add a new GitLab trigger.
. In the *Filters* section, select *Only Build Merge Requests*.

[#build-pull-requests-from-forked-repositories]
=== Build pull requests from forked repositories

include::../_includes/partials/notes/standalone-unsupported.adoc[This feature is not supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center]

Many open source projects accept PRs from forked repositories. Building these PRs is an effective way to catch bugs before manually reviewing changes.

By default, CircleCI does not build PRs from forked repositories. To change this setting, go to the menu:Project Settings[Advanced] of your project and set the *Build forked pull requests* option to _On_.

If a user submits a pull request to your repository from a fork, but no pipeline is triggered, then the user most likely is following a project fork on their personal account rather than the project itself of CircleCI, causing the jobs to trigger under the user's personal account and not the organization account. To resolve this issue, have the user unfollow their fork of the project on CircleCI and instead follow the source project. This will trigger their jobs to run under the organization when they submit pull requests.

[#pass-secrets-to-builds-from-forked-pull-requests]
=== Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests

include::../_includes/partials/notes/standalone-unsupported.adoc[This feature is not supported for GitLab, GitHub App or Bitbucket Data Center]

Running an unrestricted build in a parent repository can be dangerous. Projects often contain sensitive information, and this information is freely available to anyone who can push code that triggers a build.

By default, CircleCI does not pass secrets to builds from forked PRs for open source projects and hides four types of configuration data:

* <<private-environment-variables,Environment variables>> set through the application.
* xref:github-integration#deploy-keys-and-user-keys[Deployment keys and user keys].
* Passphraseless private SSH keys you have xref:add-ssh-key#[added to CircleCI] to access arbitrary hosts during a build.
* xref:deploy-to-aws#[AWS permissions] and configuration files.

Forked PR builds of open source projects that require secrets will not run successfully on CircleCI until you enable this setting.

If you wish to use OpenID Connect in your project, the OIDC tokens will _only_ be generated if you have this setting turned on. This prevents your token data being shared with forked builds unless you require it. If you do choose to use OIDC with open source projects by enabling the *Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests* option, you *must* check the `oidc.circleci.com/vcs-origin` claims in your policies to avoid forked builds having access to resources outside those that you require. For more information on OIDC, see the xref:openid-connect-tokens#[Using OpenID Connect tokens in jobs] page.

If you are comfortable sharing secrets with anyone who forks your project and opens a PR, you can enable the *Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests* option:

. Navigate to the menu:Project Settings[Advanced] page in the CircleCI web app for your project.
. Set the *Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests* option to _On_.

[#caching]
=== Caching

Caches are isolated based on GitHub Repo for PRs. CircleCI uses the GitHub
repository-id of the originator of the fork PR to identify the cache.

* PRs from the same fork repo will share a cache. For example, PRs from the
main repo share a cache with the main repo branches (in particular the
`main` branch).
* Two PRs in different fork repos will have different caches. That means
that a PR from a fork will not share a cache with the main repo `main` branch.
* enabling the <<pass-secrets-to-builds-from-forked-pull-requests,passing of secrets to build from forked pull requests>>
will enable cache sharing between the original repo and all forked builds.

Currently there is no pre-population of caches because this optimization has not made it to the top of the priority list yet.

[#example-open-source-projects]
== Example open source projects

Following are a few examples of projects (big and small) that build on CircleCI:

* *https://github.com/facebook/flow/[Flow]* - Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality.
* *https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook[Storybook]* - Interactive UI component develop and test: React, React Native, Vue, Angular, Ember.
* *https://github.com/apollographql[Apollo]* - A community building flexible open source tools for GraphQL.
* *https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso[Calypso]* - The next generation web app powering WordPress.com.
