:page-description: A guide for test splitting and running tests across parallel compute environments to optimize your CircleCI pipelines.
:experimental:

:page-layout: classic-docs


Use parallelism and test splitting to:

* Reduce the time taken for the testing portion of your CI/CD pipeline.
* Specify a number of xref:executor-intro#[executors] across which to split your tests.
* Split your test suite using one of the options provided by the CircleCI CLI: by name, size or by using timing data.

If you are interested to read about concurrent job runs, see the xref:concurrency#[Concurrency overview] page.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Pipelines are often configured so that a set of tests are run each time code is committed. The more tests your project has, the longer it will take for them to complete using a single compute resource. To reduce this time, you can split your tests and run them across multiple, parallel-running execution environments. Test splitting is a great way to speed up the testing portion of your CI/CD pipeline.

CircleCI test splitting lets you intelligently define where splits happen across a test suite:

* By *name*
* By *size*
* Using *timing* data

It is also possible to use the CLI to <<manual-allocation,manually allocate tests>> across parallel environments.

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

The following how-to guide walks you through the steps required to glob your test files, split your tests evenly across parallel containers or VMs, and then run your tests in parallel:

* *How-to*: xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#[Use the CircleCI CLI to split tests]

[#specify-a-jobs-parallelism-level]
== Specify parallel environments for a test job

Test suites are conventionally defined at the xref:jobs-steps#[job] level in your `.circleci/config.yml` file.
The `parallelism` key specifies how many independent executors are set up to run the job.

To run a job's steps in multiple, parallel execution environments, set the `parallelism` key to a value greater than `1`. In the example below, `parallelism` is set to `4`, meaning four identical execution environments will be set up for the job, in this case, four Docker containers using the `cimg/base:2023.09` image.

Use the `circleci tests run` command to split _and_ run your tests. Your tests will be split up, and a portion of your tests run in each execution environment. This reduces the overall time taken to run the full test suite. In this example tests will be split up into four, and the split points are calculated based on historic timing data.

[,yaml]
----
# ~/.circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --" --split-by=timings --timings-type=name

[#use-parallelism-with-self-hosted-runners]
=== Use parallelism with self-hosted runners

To use the parallelism feature with jobs that use xref:runner-overview#[self-hosted runners], ensure that you have at least two self-hosted machine runners associated with the runner resource class that your job will run on. If you set the parallelism value to be greater than the number of active self-hosted runners in a given resource class, the excess parallel tasks that do not have a self-hosted runner on which to execute will queue until a self-hosted runner is available.

If you are using parallelism on xref:container-runner#[Container Runner], you will need to make sure that `agent.maxConcurrentTasks` and your Kubernetes cluster can accommodate the number of parallel tasks you want to run. If you do not have adequate resources, your parallel runs will be subject to queuing.

For more information, see the xref:configuration-reference#parallelism[Configuration reference] page.

[#how-test-splitting-works]
== How test splitting works

CircleCI's test splitting feature allows you to specify a number of identical execution environments for a job (parallelism), and then split your test suite into an equal number of portions so that the tests can be run in parallel to reduce the length of time taken for your test pipeline. You can split your tests up in a few different ways:

* Alphabetically, by name. This is the default:
+
[,yaml]
----
# ~/.circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --"
----

* By size:
+
[,yaml]
----
# ~/.circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --" --split-by=filesize
----

* By using historic timing data:
+
[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --" --split-by=timings --timings-type=name
----

When using timing-based test splitting, the CLI attempts to auto detect the granularity of the test split (for example, whether to split by file name, or down to class name) based on the input to the split command. You may need to choose a different timing type depending on how your test coverage output is formatted, using the `--timings-type` option. Valid timing types are:

* `name` - test name
* `classname`  class name
* `file` - file name

[#example-using-timing-based-test-splitting]
=== Example using timing-based test splitting

Using *timing-based* test splitting as an example, timing data from the _previous_ test run is used to split a test suite as evenly as possible over a specified number of test environments running in parallel. This delivers the lowest possible test time for the compute power in use.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/test_splitting.png[Test Splitting]

Timings-based test splitting gives the most accurate split, and is guaranteed to optimize with each test suite run. The most recent timings data is always used to define where splits are made.

As an example, take a Go test suite. Here, all tests run sequentially in a single test environment, a Docker container:

[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go test
----

To split these tests using timing data:

. Introduce parallelism to spin up a number of identical test environments (4 in this example)
. Use the `circleci tests run` command, with the `--split-by=timings` flag to split the tests evenly across all executors.

[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go list ./... | circleci tests run --command "xargs gotestsum --junitfile junit.xml --format testname --" --split-by=timings --timings-type=name
----

For a more detailed walkthrough, read the xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#[guide to using the CLI to split tests], or follow our xref:test-splitting-tutorial#[Test splitting tutorial].

The first time the tests are run there will be no timing data for the command to use, but on subsequent runs the test time will be optimized.

[#the-tests-run-command]
=== The tests run command

Use the `circleci tests run` command to run your tests, split your tests across parallel executors and take advantage of the xref:rerun-failed-tests#[rerun failed tests] options.

The following table show a full list of option flags available when using `circleci tests run`.

|===
| Flag | Type | Description | Required?

| `--command`
| string
| The command string is the script that will be run for a list of tests determined by the options provided to the plugin
| Yes

| `--index`
| uint
| index of node can also be set with CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX. (default 1)
| No

| `--split-by`
| string
| how to weight the split, allowed values are `name`, `filesize`, and `timings`. (default `name`)
| No

| `--timings-type`
| string
| name of the field to use from historical test results when matching against the test names given to the command in order to determine their historical timings, previous status and flakiness. Available values: `classname`, `name`, `file` (default).
| No

| `--total`
| uint
| number of nodes can also be set with CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL. (default 2)
| No

| `-v`, `--verbose`
| --
| enable verbose logging output.
| No
|===

[#the-tests-split-command]
=== The tests split command

It is also possible to split tests using the `circleci tests split` command. Using the example from above, splitting the Go tests would be done as follows:

[,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/go:1.18.1
    parallelism: 4
    resource_class: large
    steps:
      - run: go test -v $(go list ./... | circleci tests split --split-by=timings)
----

The `circleci tests split` command has been superseded by `circleci tests run` as this command also gives you access to the xref:rerun-failed-tests#[rerun failed tests] options.

Integrating with some <<other-ways-to-split-tests,third party tools>> might still require you to use `circleci tests split`. For usage steps see, xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#tests-split-examples[Use the CircleCI CLI to split tests].

[#junit-xml-reports]
=== JUnit XML report formatting

In order to use the test splitting feature, CircleCI requires test results to be uploaded as JUnit XML reports. The following formatting allows CircleCI to parse timing data from test results and use the data for test splitting:

* The `file` attribute, either on the `<testsuite>` or `<testcase>` tag
* The `time` attribute, on the `<testcase>` tag

The following example is a snippet from an XML file with a format that CircleCI can parse:

[,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<testsuites name="Mocha Tests" tests="3" failures="1">
  <testsuite tests="3">
    <testcase classname="foo1" name="ASuccessfulTest" time="10" file="src/__tests__/App.test.js" />
    <testcase classname="foo2" name="AnotherSuccessfulTest" time="5" file="src/__tests__/App.test.js" />
    <testcase classname="foo3" name="AFailingTest" time="1.1050" file="src/__tests__/App.test.js">
        <failure type="NotEnoughFoo"> details about failure </failure>
    </testcase>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>
----

[#manual-allocation]
== Manual allocation

For full control over how tests are split across parallel executors, CircleCI provides two environment variables that you can use in place of the CLI to configure each container individually.

* `$CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL` is the total number of parallel containers being used to run your job.
* `$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` is the index of the specific container that is currently running.

The CLI looks up the number of available execution environments (`$CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL`), along with the current container index (`$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX`). Then, it uses deterministic splitting algorithms to split the test files across all available containers.

The number of containers is specified by the xref:configuration-reference#parallelism[`parallelism` key] in the project configuration file.

The current container index is automatically picked up from the `$CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` environment variable, but can be manually set by using the `--index` flag.

[,shell]
----
cat test_filenames.txt | circleci tests run --command=">index0.txt xargs echo" --index=0 --split-by=name
----
