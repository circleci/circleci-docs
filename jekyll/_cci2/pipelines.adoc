CircleCI pipelines are the highest-level unit of work, and they are described by a configuration file, for example, `.circleci/config.yml`. _Triggers_ can be set up to automate when a pipeline will be triggered. Pipelines coordinate the execution of workflows and jobs to build, test, and deploy your code. Workflows can be conditional, based on xref:workflows#using-filters-in-your-workflows[filters], xref:workflows#workflows-configuration-examples[job requirements], and xref:selecting-a-workflow-to-run-using-pipeline-parameters#[pipeline parameters].

Pipelines include your workflows, which coordinate your jobs. Pipelines have a fixed, linear lifecycle, and are associated with a specific actor. Pipelines trigger when a change is pushed to a project that has a CircleCI configuration file included, and can also be scheduled, triggered manually through the CircleCI app, or using the API.

== Dashboard
When visiting your CircleCI dashboard, you are shown a list of recently-triggered pipelines for your organization.

== Pipeline architecture

A pipeline is composed of workflows, which are composed of jobs. By navigating from a pipeline to a specific job, you can access your job output, test results, and artifacts through several tabs.

The output of each job can be opened in a new tab (in either raw or formatted styling) with a unique link, making it shareable between team members.

== Pipelines and triggers

Set up pipelines and triggers to define when and how pipelines are automatically triggered for a project. These triggers may be from external services (custom webhooks), or from commits or tags on a version control system.

=== Pipelines

Pipelines define units of work that can be run within your projects.
Each pipeline is defined by two key characteristics:

* A configuration file, which is stored in a repository referred to as config source, at a path of your choosing. The default config source location is `.circleci/config.yml`, but any file path with extension `*.yml` can be used.
* A checkout source, which determines which repository will be checked out when running a xref:configuration-reference#checkout[checkout step]. This model allows your CircleCI config to be stored in a different repository from your code.

A project can have one or more pipelines, and each pipeline can be associated with one or more triggers.

When you create a project in CircleCI and connect it to a repository, a first pipeline is set up for you automatically. The connected configuration file is either a file you commit yourself or one generated by CircleCI based on the code in your project.

==== Add or edit a pipeline

TIP: If you created a project xref:create-project#[in the CircleCI web app] you will find a pipeline is already set up.

image::add-pipeline.png[Add a pipeline]

To add or edit a pipeline, follow these steps:

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Select the ellipsis next to your project (icon:ellipsis-h[]) and choose **Project Settings**.
. Select **Pipelines** in the sidebar.
+
. Select btn:[Add Pipeline], or, if you wish to edit an existing pipeline select the pencil icon on the right.
. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give your pipeline a descriptive name, for example `Run tests and deploy`.
** Under Integration select the platform that matches where your project is set up (for example, GitHub App).  If you integrate with  xref:github-integration#[CircleCI's GitHub OAuth App]) you can select GitHub App here to install the App into your org and access xref:github-integration#using-github-app-functionality[improved security and new features].
+
NOTE: For GitLab Self-managed, you can input any instance that you have previously set up in CircleCI. If you wish to set a different feature branch or repository from a self-managed instance as a new pipeline, you will first need to add a new connection via your xref:gitlab-integration#organization-settings-integrations[menu:Organization Settings[Integrations]]. In either case, you will also need to enter your personal access token again to authorize this connection.
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[]
** Define where the config file for this pipeline is stored:
*** Select a repository from the dropdown.
*** Enter the path to the config file.
** Under Build Assets, select a checkout Source for this pipeline. This is the repository that will be checked out when a xref:configuration-reference#checkout[checkout step] is run. If your config is stored in the same repository as your code, pick the same repository you selected for the field Config Source.
. Select btn:[Save].

Once you have set up a pipeline you need to set up a trigger to connect it to. This is described in the following section.

=== Triggers

TIP: If you created a project xref:create-project#[in the CircleCI web app] you will find a trigger is already set up.

Triggers are rules to define that a pipeline should be run on a given event. A project can have one or more triggers, which are associated with events from a source of change. The most common type of trigger is a VCS event, for example a push to a branch on a GitHub repository, but any system that can emit outbound webhooks can also be set up as a trigger. A trigger can have only one pipeline but a pipeline can have multiple triggers.

A trigger kicks off a pipeline to run the workflows defined in your connected config source.

==== Add a trigger

To add a trigger for a pipeline, follow these steps:

[.tab.trigger.Custom_webhook]
--

Setting up a custom webhook trigger allows you to trigger pipelines from external services. Any service that can emit a webhook or make a cURL request can be set up in this way to trigger a pipeline. For more information, see the xref:triggers-overview#trigger-a-pipeline-from-a-custom-webhook[Triggers overview] page.

To add a trigger for a custom webhook, follow these steps:

{% include snippets/custom-webhook-setup.adoc %}

To verify your trigger is set up correctly, trigger an event from your third party system.
--

[.tab.trigger.GitHub]
--

When the CircleCI GitHub App is installed for your organization, GitHub starts to send events for the repositories you have granted access to. CircleCI listens for push and tag events. When a trigger is created CircleCI has enough information to use the event data to determine if a pipeline should be triggered.

image::add-trigger.png[Add a trigger]

To add a trigger for a pipeline, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select **Projects** in the sidebar
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]) next to it and choose **Project Settings**.
. Select **Triggers** in the sidebar.
+
. Select btn:[Add Trigger].
. Select the same location in the "Connect to" dropdown menu that you selected for your pipeline (for example, GitHub App).
. Select btn:[Next].
. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give your trigger a descriptive name.
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[].
** Select the Trigger source repository
** Choose your pipeline from the "Choose pipeline to run" menu.
** If prompted, enter a Config branch. This is the name of the branch that should be used to fetch your config file when a pipeline is triggered. This field is only required if your config is stored in a repository that is not the source of your trigger.
** If prompted, enter a Checkout branch. This is the name of the branch that should be used to check out your code when a link:https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#checkout[checkout step] is run. This field is only required if your chosen pipeline's Checkout source repository is not the source of your trigger.
. Select btn:[Save].

To verify your trigger is set up correctly, trigger an event from your repository.
--

[.tab.trigger.GitLab]
--

When a trigger is created, CircleCI registers a webhook with GitLab. Push events from GitLab are sent to CircleCI. CircleCI then uses the event data to determine _if_ a pipeline should run, and if so, _which_ pipeline should be run.

In addition to a pipeline, each trigger includes the webhook URL, and in this scenario, a CircleCI-created GitLab token. The webhook URL and GitLab token are used to securely register the webhook within GitLab in order to receive push events from your GitLab repository. You can view webhooks for a project in GitLab at menu:Settings[Webhooks].

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/add-trigger.png[Add a trigger]

To add a trigger for a pipeline, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select **Projects** in the sidebar
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]) next to it and choose **Project Settings**.
. Select **Triggers** in the sidebar.
+
TIP: If you do not see **Triggers** in the sidebar, your project is integrated using either xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth] or xref:bitbucket-integration#[Bitbucket Cloud] and these steps do not apply.
. Select btn:[Add Trigger].
. Select the same location in the "Connect to" dropdown menu that you selected for your pipeline (for example, GitLab).
. Select btn:[Next].
. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give your trigger a descriptive name.
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[] (Not required for custom webhooks).
+
NOTE: For GitLab self-managed you can enter the URL for an instance you have previously set up with CircleCI. You will need to enter the relevant personal access token again here to authorize the connection.
** Select your repository from the dropdown menu. This should match the repository your pipeline is connected to (not required for custom webhooks).
** Choose your pipeline from the "Choose config to run" menu.
** (Optional) You can configure <<trigger-filters,trigger filters>>.
. Select btn:[Save]
+
CAUTION: When setting up a trigger you will see a modal titled **Webhook URL** requesting that you set up a webhook in GitLab. **You do not need to take action**. The webhook is set up automatically by CircleCI. This is a known issue and will be fixed.

To verify your trigger is set up correctly, trigger an event from your repository.

[#trigger-filters]**Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should initiate a build based on the parameters provided by Gitlab’s webhook. CircleCI provides some common options, for example, only build on merge requests, but you can also build your own rules using the custom filter option. For example, a custom filter would allow you to only build on a specific branch or user.

[#visual-studio-code-extension]
== VS Code extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also monitor and interact with your pipelines directly from VS Code with the xref:vs-code-extension-overview#[official CircleCI extension]. The extension allows you to customize which projects and pipelines you want to follow, as well as view job logs and test results, download artifacts, approve, re-run, and debug jobs with SSH, and get notified when your workflows fail or need approval.
