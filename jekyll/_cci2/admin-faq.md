#### Can I monitor available build containers?

Yes, refer to the [Introduction to Nomad Cluster Operation]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/nomad) document for details. Refer to the [Administrative Variables, Monitoring, and Logging]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/monitoring/) document for how to enable additional container monitoring for AWS.

#### How do I provision admin users?

The first user who logs in to the CircleCI application will automatically be designated an admin user. Options for designating additional admin users are found under the Users page in the Admin section at `https://[domain-to-your-installation]/admin/users`.

#### How can I retrieve the passphrase and private IP address if it is lost?

SSH into into the services box, and run the following:

```
$ # To get the passphrase
$ circleci get-secret-token
CIRCLE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
$
$ # To get private ip address
$ ifconfig eth0 | grep "inet addr"
          inet addr:10.0.0.235  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
```

#### How can I change my passphrase?

1. Change your passphrase on the system console (services box port 8800) settings page.

2. Restart the application.

3. Update `CIRCLE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE` in the `init` script that you use to add Nomad Clients to your fleet.

New Nomad Clients joining the fleet will use the new passphrase. Existing Nomad Clients with the old passphrase will also continue functioning. But, it is best practice to restart these boxes as soon as you can to use the consistent passphrase across your fleet.


#### How can I gracefully shutdown a Nomad Clients?

Refer to the [Introduction to Nomad Cluster Operation]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0/nomad) document for details.

#### Is it possible to run iOS/macOS builds on CircleCI?

Support for running your own macOS fleet is coming soon. Contact your account team to express interest in getting on the early access list.

#### Why is Test GitHub Authentication failing?

This means that the GitHub Enterprise server is not returning the intermediate SSL certificates. Check your GitHub Enterprise instance with <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html> - it may report some missing intermediate certs. You can use tools like <https://whatsmychaincert.com/> to get the full certificate chain for your server.

#### How can I use HTTPS to access CircleCI?

While CircleCI creates a self-signed cert when starting up, that certificate only applies to the management console and not the CircleCI product itself. If you want to use HTTPS, you'll have to provide certificates to use under the `Privacy` section of the settings in the management console.

#### Why doesn't terraform destroy every resource?

We set the services box to have termination protection in AWS. We also write to an s3 bucket. If you want terraform to destroy every resource, you'll have to either manually delete the instance, or turn off termination protection in the circleci.tf file. You'll also need to empty the s3 bucket that was created as part of the terraform install.'


#### Do the builders store any state?

They can be torn down without worry as they don't persist any data.


#### How do I verify TLS settings are failing?

Make sure that your keys are in unencrypted PEM format, and that the certificate includes the entire chain of trust as follows:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
your_domain_name.crt
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
intermediate 1
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
intermediate 2
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
...
```

#### How do I debug the Management Console (Replicated)?

If you're experiencing any issues with Replicated, here are a few ways to debug it.

- Check the current version of Replicated installed

First, make sure you have the CLI tool for Replicated installed:

```
replicated -version
```

- Restart Replicated and the CircleCI app

Try restarting Replicated services. You can do this by running the following commands on the service box:

```
sudo service replicated-ui restart
sudo service replicated restart
sudo service replicated-operator restart
```

Then, go to your services box admin (i.e. https://YOUR-CCIE-INSTALL:8800) and try restarting with "Stop Now" and "Start Now".

- Trying to log into Replicated

Try to log in to Replicated. You can do this by running the following commands on the service box. You will only be asked to enter password, which is the same one used to unlock the admin (i.e.: https://YOUR-CCIE-INSTALL:8800).

```
replicated login
```

If you could login, then please run the following command too and give us the output.

```
sudo replicated apps
```

You are getting Error: `request returned Unauthorized for API route`.. error probably because you are not logged into Replicated, so please check if you are still getting the error after successful login.

- Check Replicated logs

You can find Replicated logs under `/var/log/replicated`.

- Check output of docker ps

Replicated starts many Docker containers to run CCIE, so it may be useful to check what containers are running.

You should see something similar to this output:

```
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                              NAMES

```

Providing us with the output of `sudo docker ps` in service box will be helpful in diagnosing the problem.
