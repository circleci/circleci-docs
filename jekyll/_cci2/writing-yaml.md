This document describes the most important features of YAML
for use in CircleCI configuration.

## Overview

[YAML](http://yaml.org) is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
It is a strict superset of [JSON](https://www.json.org/),
another data serialization language.
This means it can do everything JSON can... and more.

CircleCI configuration is stored in a single YAML file located at `~/.circleci/config.yml`,
where `~` is the root of your project's directory.
Since most of your work with CircleCI occurs in this file,
it is important to understand the basics of YAML formatting.

## How to Write YAML

The basic structure of a YAML file is a [hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
and consists of one or more key-value pairs.

```yaml
key: value
```

You can set another key-value pair as a value
by indenting the nested key.

```yaml
key:
  another_key: "another value"
```

### Multi-line Strings

If the value is a multi-line string,
use the `>` character,
followed by any number of lines.
This is especially useful for lengthy commands.

```yaml
haiku: >
  Consider me
  As one who loved poetry
  And persimmons.
```

**Note**:
Quotes are not necessary
when using multiline strings.

### Sequences

Keys and values are not restricted to [scalars](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/238033/what-does-it-mean-when-data-is-scalar).
You can also map a scalar to a sequence.

```yaml
scalar:
  - never
  - gonna
  - give
  - you
  - up
```

Items in sequences can also be key-value pairs.

```yaml
simulation:
  - within: "a simulation"
  - without:
      a_glitch: "in the matrix"
```

**Note**:
Remember to properly indent a key-value pair
when it is the value of an item in a sequence.

### Anchors and Aliases

To [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) up your `config.yml`,
use anchors and aliases.
Anchors are identified by an `&` character,
and aliases by an `*` character.

```yaml
song:
  - &name Al
  - You
  - can
  - call
  - me
  - *name
```

When the above list is read by a YAML parser,
the literal output looks like this.

```yaml
song:
  - Al
  - You
  - can
  - call
  - me
  - Al
```

### Merging Maps

Anchors and aliases work for scalar values,
but to save maps or sequences,
use `<<` to inject the alias.

```yaml
default: &default
  school: hogwarts

harry:
  <<: *default
  house: gryffindor

draco:
  <<: *default
  house: slytherin
```

You can also merge multiple maps.

```yaml
good: &one
  - harry
  - ron
bad: &two
  - crabbe
  - goyle
students:
  <<: [*one, *two]
```

While YAML has several other features,
the examples above should be enough
to get you started with YAML
and keep your CircleCI configuration concise.
If you are hungry for more knowledge,
here are a few ideas.

- For a concrete example of keys and values,
see the [Configuring CircleCI]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) document.
- If you are unsure whether your `config.yml` is valid YAML,
[run it through a validator](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/).

Learn X in Y Minutes has [a great summary](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).
