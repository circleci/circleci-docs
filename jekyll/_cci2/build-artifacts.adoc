Build artifacts persist data after a job is completed. They can be used for longer-term storage of your build process outputs. For example, when a Java build/test process finishes, the output of the process is saved as a `.jar` file. CircleCI can store this file as an artifact, keeping it available long after the process has finished.

== Safe and Unsafe Content Types
By default, only pre-defined artifact types are allowed. This protects users from uploading, and potentially executing malicious content. The 'allowed-list' is as follows:
