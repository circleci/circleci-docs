$availableAgents = (Invoke-WebRequest "https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-runner/manifest.json" -UseBasicParsing).Content.Trim() | ConvertFrom-Json
$agentURL = $availableAgents.releases.$runnerVersion.windows.amd64.url
$agentHash = $availableAgents.releases.$runnerVersion.windows.amd64.sha256
$agentFile = $agentURL.Split("/")[-1]

Invoke-WebRequest $agentURL -OutFile $agentFile -UseBasicParsing
if ((Get-FileHash "$agentFile" -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower() -ne $agentHash.ToLower()) {
