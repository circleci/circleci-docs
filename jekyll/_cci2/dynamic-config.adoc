:description: A guide to using CircleCI's dynamic configuration features
:page-layout: classic-docs

Dynamic configuration in CircleCI is the process of describing a pipeline in which the work done is dynamically determined. Dynamic configuration is flexible. The features described in this guide allow you to create a configuration to match the requirements of your specific project.

Dynamic configuration can mean:

* The work is determined by values passed in at runtime as _pipeline parameters_.
* The configuration file is dynamically generated by the pipeline using a template rather than being static YAML
* A project's configuration is pieced together dynamically depending on specific xref:pipeline-variables#[Pipeline values] or file paths.
* Using conditional logic and parameterization to determine the work to be done.
* Triggering pipelines defined by configurations that exist outside the default parent `.circleci/` directory.

== Quickstart

[#enable-dynamic-config]
=== Enable dynamic configuration

NOTE: Projects created **after** December 1st 2023 have dynamic config enabled by default. If this applies to your project, you can skip this step.

To enable dynamic configuration in CircleCI:

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Projects** in the sidebar
. Select the icon:ellipsis-h[ellipsis] next to your project and select **Project Settings**
. From the sidebar, select *Advanced*.
. Scroll to the *Enable dynamic config using setup workflows* setting, and toggle it to the "on" position, as shown below:
+

These steps make dynamic configuration features available for your project, but any _static_ `config.yml` you have previously set up will continue to work as normal.

=== Use dynamic configuration

Add the key `setup: true` to the top level of your _parent_ configuration file to designate that `config.yml` as a `setup` configuration.

[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

setup: true
----

For some basic examples of using dynamic configuration, see the xref:using-dynamic-configuration#[Using dynamic configuration] how-to guide.

== Config continuation constraints

Some constraints on continuing pipelines from a `setup: true` configuration are as follows:

- The `setup` configuration must be `version: 2.1`.
- The `setup` configuration must only allow one workflow to run in each pipeline. For example:
** Have only one workflow configured.
** Use logic conditions to ensure only one workflow is run for each pipeline.
- A pipeline can only be continued once. A pipeline cannot be continued with another setup configuration. Workflow reruns will fail as part of this restriction. Rather than rerun a setup workflow you can trigger a new pipeline.
- A pipeline can only be continued within six hours of its creation.
- Pipeline parameters submitted at continuation time cannot overlap with pipeline parameters submitted at trigger (setup) time.
- Pipeline parameters declared in the `setup` configuration must also be declared in the continuation configuration. These parameters can be used at continuation time. For more information, see the xref:pipeline-variables#pipeline-parameters-and-dynamic-configuration[Pipeline values and parameters] page.

[#how-dynamic-config-works]
== How dynamic config works

CircleCI's dynamic configuration is made up of the following resources, which can be used together to fit a variety of use cases:

* The xref:configuration-reference#setup[`setup` config field] allows you to designate a configuration file as _dynamic_, allowing the use of dynamic configuration features. When a configuration is dynamic (`setup: true`) the `CIRCLE_CONTINUATION_KEY` environment variable is available, which is a secret, unique-per-pipeline key that is automatically injected into the build environment for jobs that run in a _setup_ configuration.
+
The `CIRCLE_CONTINUATION_KEY` environment variable is required to authorize the continuation of one configuration to another via the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/continuePipeline[continue a pipeline] API v2 endpoint. The API also accepts a configuration string, as well as a set of pipeline parameters.
+
A _setup_ configuration:
+
** Continues your pipeline on to the desired next configuration.
** Can contain jobs that compute pipeline parameters, which can then be passed into an additional configuration that potentially exists in other directories.
** Can be used to generate new configurations via pre-existing scripts.

* Use the API v2 link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/continuePipeline[continue a pipeline] endpoint to continue a pipeline from one configuration to another. This endpoint can be used directly or via one of the dynamic configuration orbs described next.

* Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering[path filtering orb] to map file paths, pipelines parameters, and configuration files to determine the work that should be done when a change happens in a specific location in a repository.

* Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation[continuation orb] to continue one configuration to another and set up any required pipeline parameters.

== Dynamic configuration examples

Some examples of using dynamic configuration in CircleCI include:

* Incorporate logic to check for file changes or parameter values so that only necessary work is done in each pipeline.
* Share common configuration across projects by generating project-specific sections dynamically based on parameters.
* _Continue_ a pipeline, or generate and run a configuration based on where code has changed.
* Split up a configuration file into reusable fragments that can be dynamically assembled.
* Generate full CircleCI configurations from small company-specifiic configurations. For example, if you have many repositories with similar CI/CD requirements, you can generate a full CircleCI YAML configuration dynamically from small template configuration written in any configuration language.
* When working with a language or framework that has its own configuration language, you can generate CircleCI config dynamically from existing configuration files.

=== Use path filtering for monorepos

Set up path filtering to set pipeline parameters and continuation configuration sources based on the location of changes in your repository.

In a monorepo (single repository) setup you can use path filtering to avoid all of your microservices/sub-projects being put through the entirety of your build, test, and deployment processes when any single update is introduced.

For example, you may have multiple projects within your repository (`project_1`, `project_2`, `project_3`). You can use path filtering to only run tests and deployment for `project_1` if change happened in the `project_1` file set. The link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering[path filtering orb] is available to help simplify your configuration further. For a full example of path filtering, see the xref:using-dynamic-configuration#execute-specific-workflows-or-steps-based-on-which-files-are-modified[Dynamic configuration how-to guide].

// #DIAGRAM OF PATH FILTERING FOR MONOREPO SETUP#

=== Use config splitting for microservices

For projects that consist of multiple modules, you may require a separate job/workflow to run for each module when changes are introduced. You can split your configuration up and store the config for each module separately within the module's directory, keeping related code and config together. Module jobs/workflows can be stored in multiple files as _fragments_ of a configuration. Instead of using one full `.circleci/config.yml` file, you can use dynamic configuration to combine these individual fragments into a full configuration when a pipeline is triggered. This scenario can also be referred to as _config splitting_.

// Diagram

For an example of config splitting, see the xref:using-dynamic-configuration#pack-generate-validate[Dynamic configuration how-to guide].

== Using dynamic configuration on CircleCI server

TIP: For more information on managing orbs in a server installation see the xref:/server/latest/operator/managing-orbs#[Managing orbs] page.

If you are using CircleCI server there are a few extra steps you will need to take to use the dynamic configuration orbs.

* You will need to import the path filtering and continuation orbs into your server installation using the following commands:
+
NOTE: These examples show importing the most recent versions of the orbs. You can also specify a SemVer version constraint to import a specific version, for example, `circleci/continuation@1.0.0`.
+
[,yaml]
----
circleci admin import-orb circleci/path-filtering --host <your-server-installation-domain> --token <your-api-token>
----
+
[,yaml]
----
circleci admin import-orb circleci/continuation --host <your-server-installation-domain> --token <your-api-token>
----

When using the path filtering orb on server you will need to add your CircleCI server domain to the `path-filtering/filter` job in your workflow, for example:

[,yaml]
----
workflows:
  setup-workflow:
    jobs:
      - path-filtering/filter:
          mapping: |
            packages/api/.* api true
            packages/auth/.* auth true
            packages/e2e/.* e2e true
            packages/unit/.* unit true
          # # Optional, defaults to main:
          base-revision: main
          circleci_domain: support-server-4.eks-dev.sphereci.com
