This page describes how to install CircleCI's machine runner 3.0 on macOS.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To install machine runners and run jobs, you will need to have root access, and have the following utilities and tools installed on your system:

* https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]

* https://curl.se/[curl] (installed by default on macOS)

* sha256sum (if not pre-installed):
** `brew install coreutils`

* https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/[tar]

* The xref:local-cli#[CircleCI CLI] if you wish to install runners from the command line

[#install-circleci-runner]
== 2. Install CircleCI runner on macOS

You can install runner on macOS with link:http://brew.sh/[Homebrew].

. On the target macOS machine with Homebrew installed, run the following command to add the CircleCI repository:
+
[,shell]
----
brew tap circleci-public/circleci
----

. Run the following command to install the `circleci-runner` package:
+
NOTE: You may see a notification indicating a background item for Circle Internet Services Inc. has been added.
+
[,shell]
----
brew install circleci-runner
----

. Open the runner `config.yaml` file with the text editor of your choice, and modify the `runner.name` and `api.auth_token` values.
+
[,shell]
----
nano $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/config.yaml
----
+
[,shell]
----
runner:
  name: "my-macos-runner"
  working_directory: "/Users/$USER/Library/com.circleci.runner/workdir"
  cleanup_working_directory: true
api:
  auth_token: "your-auth-token"
----
Replace `api.auth_token` with the token generated in the steps above, and choose a name for your runner.

. If you are using CircleCI server you will need to provide the URL for your install. You can do this by either setting the `CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL` environment variable:
+
[source,shell]
----
export CIRCLECI_RUNNER_API_URL="your server domain"
----
+
Or by adding the URL to `$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/config.yaml` using text editor of your choice.
+
[source,yaml]
----
api:
  auth_token: "your-auth-token"
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation.
  url: https://your.domain.here
----

[#migrate-existing-configuration-files]
=== Migrate existing configuration files
If you are migrating an existing configuration from a previous runner installation, you may move the existing launch agent file from its current path to the new path.

NOTE: this will overwrite the default config file installed via brew and replace it with your existing config file.

[,shell]
----
mv /Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/launch-agent-config.yaml $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/config.yaml
----

After copying the file, you may remove the logging block to send logs to the default location for machine runner 3.0 (specified below):

[,yaml]
----
# remove this block from your existing config
logging:
  file: /Library/Logs/com.circleci.runner.log
----

[#review-accept-apple-signature-notarization]
== 3. Review and accept the Apple signature notarization

The binary must be approved to run on your macOS system because the self-hosted runner is not compiled from source during installation. This can be done via the macOS UI by accepting the pop-up asking if you wish to run the binary from the internet, or programmatically.

. Verify the signature and notarization with this command:
+
[source,shell]
----
spctl -a -vvv -t install "$(brew --prefix)/bin/circleci-runner"
----
+
It should return an output that looks like this:
+
[source,shell]
----
/opt/homebrew/bin/circleci-runner: accepted
source=Notarized Developer ID
origin=Developer ID Application: Circle Internet Services Inc.
----

. When ready, run the command to accept the notarization. You will need to enter the macOS system password.
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "$(brew --prefix)/bin/circleci-runner"
----

[#start-macos-machine-runner]
== 4. Start macOS machine runner 3.0

To start the macOS machine runner 3.0 for the first time, you will need to bootstrap the service. Depending on whether you are using a GUI or non-GUI session (for example, when remotely tunneling into the machine), the commands to bootstrap the service will differ:

[.tab.startdomain.GUI_domain]
--

. For running the agent in a GUI session, you can bootstrap the provided `.plist` file and enable the service by running the following commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
launchctl enable gui/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
. Finally, you can check the service is running by invoking the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--

[.tab.startdomain.User_domain]
--

1. When using a non-GUI (or headless) session, the provided `.plist` file should be moved to `/Library/LaunchAgents`. This location is for per-user agents configured by the administrator, which allows the service to load after a reboot. Run the following command to do this:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo mv $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/
----
2. Now you can bootstrap the `.plist` file and enable the service by running the following commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
launchctl bootstrap user/$(id -u) /Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
launchctl enable user/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
launchctl kickstart -k user/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
3. Finally, you can check the service is running by invoking the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
launchctl print user/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--

[#stop-macos-machine-runner]
== 5. Stop macOS machine runner 3.0

To stop the machine runner service, run the following command to disable the machine runner service, depending on the service target used in the previous step:

[.tab.stopdomain.GUI_domain]
--

[source,shell]
----
launchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--
[.tab.stopdomain.User_domain]
--

[source,shell]
----
launchctl disable user/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--

[#uninstall-machine-runner-macos]
== Uninstall machine runner 3.0 on macOS
To uninstall machine runner 3.0 from your macOS device, follow these steps.

. Stop the machine runner service by using the following command to disable it, depending on the service target used during installation:
+
[.tab.uninstalldomain.GUI_domain]
--
Targeting the GUI domain:
[source,shell]
----
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--
+
[.tab.uninstalldomain.User_domain]
--
Targeting the user domain:
[source,shell]
----
launchctl bootout user/$(id -u)/com.circleci.runner
----
--
. Uninstall machine runner:
+
[.tab.machine-runner-uninstall-macos.Keep_logs_and_configuration]
--
To uninstall without purging logs and configuration files, run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
brew uninstall --cask circleci-public/homebrew-circleci/circleci-runner
----
--
+
[.tab.machine-runner-uninstall-macos.Purge_logs_and_configuration]
--

CAUTION: This command will *purge all logs and configuration files*.

To uninstall and purge all logs and configuration files, run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
brew uninstall --cask --zap circleci-public/homebrew-circleci/circleci-runner
----
--

[#access-runner-logs]
== Access runner logs
On your macOS machine, logs from `circleci-runner` are located in the following directory by default.

[source,shell]
----
$HOME/Library/Logs/com.circleci.runner/runner.log
----

{% include snippets/machine-runner-example.adoc %}

The job will then execute using your self-hosted runner when you push the `.circleci/config.yml` to your VCS provider.
