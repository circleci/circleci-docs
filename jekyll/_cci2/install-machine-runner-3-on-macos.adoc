This page describes how to install CircleCI's machine runner 3.0 on macOS.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To install machine runners and run jobs, you will need to have root access, and have the following utilities and tools installed on your system:

* https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]

* https://curl.se/[curl] (installed by default on macOS)

* sha256sum (if not pre-installed):
** `brew install coreutils`

* https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/[tar]

* The xref:local-cli#[CircleCI CLI] if you wish to install runners from the command line

[#install-circleci-runner]
== 2. Install CircleCI runner on macOS

You can install runner on macOS with link:http://brew.sh/[Homebrew].

. On the target macOS machine with Homebrew installed, run the following command to add the CircleCI repository:
+
[,shell]
----
brew tap circleci-public/circleci
----

. Run the following command to install the `circleci-runner` package:
+
NOTE: You may see a notification indicating a background item for Circle Internet Services Inc. has been added.
+
[,shell]
----
brew install circleci-runner
----

. Open the runner `config.yaml` file with the text editor of your choice, and modify the `[[RUNNER_NAME]]` and `[[RESOURCE_CLASS_TOKEN]]` template values.
+
[,shell]
----
nano $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/config.yaml
----
+
[,shell]
----
runner:
  name: "my-macos-runner"
  working_directory: "/Users/$USER/Library/com.circleci.runner/workdir"
  cleanup_working_directory: true
api:
  auth_token: "your-auth-token"
----

. Replace `[[RESOURCE_CLASS_TOKEN]]` with the token generated in the steps above, and choose a name for your runner.

[#migrate-existing-configuration-files]
=== Migrate existing configuration files
If you are migrating an existing configuration from a previous runner installation, you may move the existing launch agent file from its current path to the new path.

NOTE: this will overwrite the default config file installed via brew and replace it with your existing config file.

[,shell]
----
mv /Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/launch-agent-config.yaml $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/config.yaml
----

After copying the file, you may remove the logging block to send logs to the default location for machine runner 3.0 (specified below):

[,yaml]
----
# remove this block from your existing config
logging:
  file: /Library/Logs/com.circleci.runner.log
----

[#review-accept-apple-signature-notarization]
== 3. Review and accept the Apple signature notarization

The binary must be approved to run on your macOS system because the self-hosted runner is not compiled from source during installation. This can be done via the macOS UI by accepting the pop-up asking if you wish to run the binary from the internet, or programmatically.

. Verify the signature and notarization with this command:
+
```shell
spctl -a -vvv -t install "$(brew --prefix)/bin/circleci-runner"
```
+
It should return an output that looks like this:
+
```shell
/opt/homebrew/bin/circleci-runner: accepted
source=Notarized Developer ID
origin=Developer ID Application: Circle Internet Services Inc.
```

. When ready, run the command to accept the notarization. You will need to enter the macOS system password.
+
```shell
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "$(brew --prefix)/bin/circleci-runner"
```

[#start-macos-machine-runner]
== 4. Start macOS machine runner 3.0

To start the macOS machine runner 3.0 for the first time, run the following commands to bootstrap and load the `plist` file:

```shell
launchctl bootstrap gui/`stat -f %u` $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
```

[#stop-macos-machine-runner]
== 5. Stop macOS machine runner 3.0

To stop the machine runner service, run the following command to unload the `plist` file:
```shell
launchctl unload $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
```

[#uninstall-machine-runner-macos]
== Uninstall machine runner 3.0 on macOS
To uninstall machine runner from your macOS device, follow these steps.

. Stop the machine runner service by using the following command to unload the `plist` file:
+
```shell
launchctl unload $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.circleci.runner.plist
```
. Uninstall machine runner:
+
[.tab.machine-runner-uninstall-macos.Keep_logs_and_configuration]
--
To uninstall without purging logs and configuration files, run the following command.

```shell
brew uninstall --cask circleci-public/homebrew-circleci/circleci-runner
```
--
+
[.tab.machine-runner-uninstall-macos.Purge_logs_and_configuration]
--

This command will *purge all logs and configuration files*.

To uninstall and purge all logs and configuration files, run the following command.

```shell
brew uninstall --cask --zap circleci-public/homebrew-circleci/circleci-runner
```

[#access-runner-logs]
== Access runner logs
On your macOS machine, logs from `circleci-runner` are located in the following directory by default.

```shell
$HOME/Library/Logs/com.circleci.runner/runner.log
```

{% include snippets/machine-runner-example.adoc %}

The job will then execute using your self-hosted runner when you push the `.circleci/config.yml` to your VCS provider.
