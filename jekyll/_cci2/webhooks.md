# Overview
{: #overview}

A webhook, sometimes referred to as a _reverse API_, allows you to connect a
platform you manage (either an API you create yourself, or with a third party
service) to a stream of _future events_ (or, _real-time information_).

Setting up a Webhook on CircleCI enables you to receive information (referred to
as _events_) from CircleCI, as they happen. This can help you avoid polling the
API, or manually checking the CircleCI web application for desired information.

The rest of this document will detail how to set up a webhook as well as the
shape of events that will be sent to your webhook destination.

# Setting up a hook
{: #setting-up-a-hook}

Webhooks are set up on a per-project basis. To get started:

- Visit a specific project you have setup on CircleCI
- Click on **Project Settings**
- In the sidebar of your Project Settings, click on **Webhooks**
- Click **Add Webhook**
- Fill out the Webhook form (the table below describes the fields and their intent):

| Field                  | Required? | Intent                                                               |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Webhook name           | Y         | The name of your webhook                                             |
| URL                    | Y         | The URL the webhook will make POST requests to.                      |
| Certificate Validation | Y         |                                                                      |
| Secret token           | Y         | Used by your API/platform to validate incoming data is from CircleCI |
| Select an event        | Y         | You must select at least one event that will trigger a webhook       |


# Event Specifications
{: #event-specifications}

CircleCI currently offers webhooks for the following events:

- Ping
- Workflow Completed
- Job Completed


## Common top level keys

Each Webhook will have some common data as part of the event:

| Field         | Description                                                                                        | Type   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `id`          | ID used to uniquely identify each event from the system (the client can use this to dedupe events) | String |
| `happened_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp representing when the event happened                                            | String |
| `webhook`     | A map of metadata representing the webhook that was triggered                                      | Map    |

**Note:** The event payloads are open maps, meaning new fields may be added to
maps in the webhook payload without considering it a breaking change.

## Ping
{: #ping}

Once you set up your Webhook, you can _ping_ your API to test that it is
working. Let's look at the _shape_ of the _event_ (referred to as a **payload**)
that will be sent to your API:

```
{
  "type": "ping",
  "id": "198c5ba2-8713-44fa-b91d-d80e5119df5d",
  "happened_at": "2021-02-03T23:49:03Z",
  "webhook": {
    "id": "32869f4e-ad1e-45c4-be08-693865dad4f5",
    "name": "My Webhook"
  }
}
```
