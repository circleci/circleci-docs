Use webhooks to:

- Build a custom dashboard to visualize or analyze workflow/job events.
- Send data to incident management tools (such as [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com)).
- Use tools like [Airtable]({{site.baseurl}}/webhooks-airtable) to capture data and visualize it.
- Alert when a workflow is cancelled, then use the API to rerun the workflow.
- Trigger notification systems to alert people when workflows/jobs complete.
- Build your own automation plugins and tools.

## Introduction
{: #introduction}

A webhook allows you to connect a platform you manage (either an API you create yourself, or a third party service) to a stream of future _events_.

Setting up a webhook on CircleCI enables you to receive information (referred to as _events_) from CircleCI, as they happen. This can help you avoid polling the API or manually checking the CircleCI web application for desired information.

## Quickstart
{: #quickstart}

Webhooks are set up on a per-project basis, either within the CircleCI app or via API.

To configure webhooks via API see our documentation for [Webhooks Public API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Webhook).

To configure webhooks within the CircleCI app:

1. Visit a specific project you have set up on CircleCI
1. Click on **Project Settings**
1. In the sidebar of your Project Settings, click on **Webhooks**
1. Click **Add Webhook**
1. Fill out the webhook form (the table below describes the fields and their intent)
1. Provided your receiving API or third party service is set up, click **Test Ping Event** to dispatch a test event. Note that the test ping event has an abbreviated payload for ease of testing. See full examples of [workflow-completed]({{site.baseurl}}/webhooks/#workflow-completed) and [job-completed]({{site.baseurl}}/webhooks/#job-completed) events below.


| Field                  | Required? | Intent                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Webhook name           | Y         | The name of your webhook                                                                    |
| URL                    | Y         | The URL the webhook will make POST requests to                                              |
| Certificate Validation | Y         | Ensure the receiving host has a valid SSL certificate before sending an event <sup>1</sup>  |
| Secret token           | N         | Used by your API/platform to validate incoming data is from CircleCI                        |
| Select an event        | Y         | You must select at least one event that will trigger a webhook                              |
{: class="table table-striped"}

<sup>1</sup>Only leave this unchecked for testing purposes.

There is a limit of 5 webhooks per project.

## Communication protocol with webhooks
{: #communication-protocol }

A webhook is sent whenever an event occurs on the CircleCI platform.

A webhook is sent using an HTTP POST to the URL that was registered when the webhook was created, with a body encoded using JSON.

CircleCI expects the server that responds to a webhook will return a 2xx response code. If a non-2xx response is received, CircleCI will retry at a later time. If CircleCI does not receive a response to the webhook within a short period of time, CircleCI will assume that delivery has failed, and will retry at a later time. The timeout period is currently 5 seconds.

Webhook requests may be duplicated. To deduplicate (prevent requests from being duplicated for a specific event), use the [`id` property](/docs/webhooks-reference/#common-top-level-keys) in the webhook payload for identification.

If you have feedback about timeouts and retries, please get [get in touch](https://circleci.canny.io/webhooks) with our team.

### Webhook headers
{: #headers }

A number of HTTP headers are set on webhooks, as detailed in the table below.

Header Name | Value
--- | ---
`content-type` | `application/json`
`user-agent` | A string indicating that the sender was CircleCI (`CircleCI-Webhook/1.0`).
`circleci-event-type` | The type of event, (`workflow-completed`, `job-completed`, etc)
`circleci-signature` | When present, this signature can be used to verify that the sender of the webhook has access to the secret token.
{: class="table table-striped"}

## Validate webhooks
{: #validate-webhooks}

You should validate incoming webhooks to verify that they are coming from CircleCI. To support this, when creating a webhook, you can optionally provide a secret token. Each outgoing HTTP request to your service will contain a `circleci-signature` header. This header will consist of a comma-separated list of versioned signatures.

```shell
POST /uri HTTP/1.1
Host: your-webhook-host
circleci-signature: v1=4fcc06915b43d8a49aff193441e9e18654e6a27c2c428b02e8fcc41ccc2299f9,v2=...,v3=...
```

Currently, the latest (and only) signature version is v1. You should *only* check the latest signature type to prevent downgrade attacks.

The v1 signature is the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body, using the configured signing secret as the secret key.

Here are some example signatures for given request bodies:

| Body                           | Secret Key       | Signature                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hello world`                  | `secret`         | `734cc62f32841568f45715aeb9f4d7891324e6d948e4c6c60c0621cdac48623a` |
| `lalala`                       | `another-secret` | `daa220016c8f29a8b214fbfc3671aeec2145cfb1e6790184ffb38b6d0425fa00` |
| `an-important-request-payload` | `hunter123`      | `9be2242094a9a8c00c64306f382a7f9d691de910b4a266f67bd314ef18ac49fa` |
{: class="table table-striped"}

The following is an example of how you might validate signatures in Python:

```python
import hmac

def verify_signature(secret, headers, body):
    # get the v1 signature from the `circleci-signature` header
    signature_from_header = {
        k: v for k, v in [
            pair.split('=') for pair in headers['circleci-signature'].split(',')
        ]
    }['v1']

    # Run HMAC-SHA256 on the request body using the configured signing secret
    valid_signature = hmac.new(bytes(secret, 'utf-8'), bytes(body, 'utf-8'), 'sha256').hexdigest()

    # use constant time string comparison to prevent timing attacks
    return hmac.compare_digest(valid_signature, signature_from_header)

# the following will return `True`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=773ba44693c7553d6ee20f61ea5d2757a9a4f4a44d2841ae4e95b52e4cd62db4'
    },
    'foo',
)

# the following will return `False`
verify_signature(
    'secret',
    {
        'circleci-signature': 'v1=not-a-valid-signature'
    },
    'foo',
)
```

## Event specifications of webhooks
{: #event-specifications}

CircleCI currently offers webhooks for the following events:

| Event type         | Description                                              | Potential statuses                                       | Included sub-entities                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| workflow-completed | A workflow has reached a terminal state                  | "success", "failed", "error", "canceled", "unauthorized" | project, organization, workflow, pipeline      |
| job-completed      | A job has reached a terminal state                       | "success", "failed", "canceled", "unauthorized"          | project, organization, workflow, pipeline, job |
