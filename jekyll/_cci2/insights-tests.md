## Overview
{: #overview }

Using CircleCI test Insights, you are able to analyze your test performance within the most recent executions and identify opportunities for test optimization. To access test insights, select the **Tests** tab on the **Workflow Insights** page.

The next sections go over what test insights are available.

### Performance summary
{: #performance-summary }

The summary section displays test suite performance across your most recent 100 runs. You can view the following:

- Average test per run
- Number of all flaky tests detected
- Failure counts
- Slow run times in test suite

### Most recent runs
{: #most-recent-runs }

The most recent runs chart displays the most recent 100 executions of the test suite. You can hover over each bar to review the following:

- Test count
- Skipped tests
- Success rate of tests

### Flaky tests
{: #flaky-tests }

Flaky tests are tests that fail non-deterministically; they pass and fail due to some state external to the repository. As a result, flaky tests introduce uncertainty to a project’s build state.

Test Insights detect flaky tests by identifying tests that failed and passed on the same commit in a 14-day window. Deterministic tests rely on the state of the repository and demonstrate the same behavior on re-runs. Additionally, these types of tests are labeled “FLAKY” throughout the CircleCI app making them easy to identify and fix.

### Most failed tests
{: #most-failed-tests }

You can view the 100 tests with the lowest success rates in their most recent pipeline executions. The table provides the following:

- Test name
- Associated job
- Run time
- Success rate

### Slowest tests
{: #slowest-tests }

You can view the 100 tests with the longest run times in their most recent pipeline executions. The table provides the following:

- Test name
- Associated job
- Run time
- Success rate
