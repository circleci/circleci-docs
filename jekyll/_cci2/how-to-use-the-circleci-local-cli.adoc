This page describes how to use some features of the CircleCI CLI.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To follow the guides on this page you will need the following:

* A CircleCI account (you can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free])
* Local installation of the CircleCI CLI. Steps and options are available on the xref:local-cli#[Installing the local CLI] page.
* xref:local-cli#configure-the-cli[Set up and configure] the CircleCI CLI.

[#validate-a-circleci-config]
== Validate a CircleCI config

TIP: *Using VS Code?* You can validate you CircleCI configuration using the VS Code extension. For full information about the features provided in the VS Code extension, see the xref:vs-code-extension-overview#[VS Code extension overview] page.

You can avoid pushing additional commits to test your `.circleci/config.yml` by using the CLI to validate your configuration locally. Follow these steps:

. Navigate to your project directory. You can  a directory with a `.circleci/config.yml` file
. Run the following, providing the path to your `.circleci/config.yml`:
+
[,shell]
----
circleci config validate <path-to-config.yml>
----

. If your configuration is valid, you should see the following:
+
[,shell]
----
Config file at .circleci/config.yml is valid
----
+
Otherwise you will see errors, for example:
+
[,shell]
----
Error: config compilation contains errors: config compilation contains errors:
	- Unable to parse YAML
	- mapping values are not allowed here
	-  in 'string', line 20, column 22:
	-               environment:
	-                          ^

[#orb-development-kit]
== Orb development kit

The <<orb-author#create-test-and-publish-an-orb,orb development kit>> refers to a suite of tools that work together to simplify the <<orb-intro#,orb>> development process, with automatic testing and deployment on CircleCI. There are two commands in the CLI that are a part of the orb development kit:

* The following command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_init.html[initializes a new orb project]:
+
[,shell]
----
circleci orb init
----

* The following command link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_pack.html[packs an orb with local scripts]:
+
[,shell]
----
circleci orb pack
----

For more information on orb packing, see the xref:orb-concepts#orb-packing[Orbs Concepts] page.

[#validate-an-orb-in-your-configuration-file]
== Validate an orb in your configuration file

You can validate your orb with the following:

[,shell]
----
circleci orb validate <path-to-your-orb.yml>
----

[#packing-a-config]
== Packing a config

[,shell]
----
circleci config pack
----

This CLI pack command (separate to `circleci orb pack` described above) allows you to create a single YAML file from several separate files (based on directory structure and file contents). The `pack` command implements link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/fyaml[FYAML], a scheme for breaking YAML documents across files in a directory tree. This is useful for breaking up source code for large orbs and allows custom organization of your orbs' YAML configuration.

How you **name** and **organize** your files when using the `pack` command will determine the final `orb.yml` output. Consider the following folder structure example:

TIP: When packing a config using `circleci config pack`, the component names are not included in the configuration files, they are taken from the file names.

[,shell]
----
$ tree
.
└── your-orb-source
    ├── @orb.yml
    ├── commands
    │   └── foo.yml
    └── jobs
        └── bar.yml

3 directories, 3 files
----

The UNIX `tree` command is great for printing out folder structures. In the example tree structure above, the `pack` command will map the folder names and file names to **YAML keys**, and map the file contents as the **values** to those keys.

The following command will `pack` up the example folder from above:

[,shell]
----
circleci config pack your-orb-source
----

And the output will be in your `.yml` file:

[,yaml]
----
# Contents of @orb.yml appear here
commands:
  foo:
    # contents of foo.yml appear here
jobs:
  bar:
    # contents of bar.yml appear here
----

[#other-configuration-packing-capabilities]
=== Other configuration packing capabilities

A file beginning with `@` will have its contents merged into its parent folder level. This can be useful at the top level of an orb, when one might want generic `orb.yml` to contain metadata, but not to map into an `orb` key-value pair.

For example, the following structure:

{% raw %}

[,shell]
----
cat foo/bar/@baz.yml
\{baz: qux}
----

{% endraw %}

Maps to:

[,yaml]
----
bar:
  baz: qux
----

[#processing-a-config]
== Processing a config

Running the following command validates your config, but will also display expanded source configuration alongside your original configuration. This is particularly useful if you are using orbs:

[,shell]
----
circleci config process <path-to-config.yml>
----

Consider the following example configuration that uses the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node[`node`] orb:

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1

orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.7.0

workflows:
  example-workflow:
      jobs:
        - node/test
----

Processing this config file will output a YAML file like the example below. This is the expanded source configuration using `version: 2` syntax. All `version: 2.1` elements are processed:

{% raw %}

[,yml]
----
# Orb 'circleci/node@4.7.0' resolved to 'circleci/node@4.7.0'
version: 2
jobs:
  node/test:
    docker:
    - image: cimg/node:13.11.0
    steps:
    - checkout
    - run:
        command: |
          if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
            echo
            echo "---"
            echo "Unable to find your package.json file. Did you forget to set the app-dir parameter?"
            echo "---"
            echo
            echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
            echo
            echo
            echo "List directory: "
            echo

            ln package-lock.json /tmp/node-project-lockfile
          elif [ -f "npm-shrinkwrap.json" ]; then

[#run-a-job-in-a-container-on-your-machine]
== Run a job in a container on your machine

The CircleCI CLI enables you to run a job from your configuration locally with Docker. This can be useful for the following:

* To run tests before pushing configuration changes
* Debugging your build process without impacting your build queue

Only single jobs can be run locally, not workflows.

[#run-job-prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

You will need to have link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] installed on your system, as well as the most recent version of the CLI. You will also need to have a project that includes a valid `.circleci/config.yml` file.

[#running-a-job]
=== Run a job

. Navigate to the root of your project containing the `.circleci/config.yml` file.

. Run the following command specifying the job you would like to run. If your CircleCI configuration is set to version 2.1, you must first export your configuration to `process.yml`, and specify it when executing with the following commands:
+
[,shell]
----
circleci config process .circleci/config.yml > process.yml
circleci local execute -c process.yml <job-name>
----
+
If you are using `version: 2` configuration, you can simply run:
+
[,shell]
----
circleci local execute <job-name>
----

The commands above will run the job you specify by name. The CLI uses Docker to pull down the requirements for the build and then execute your CI steps locally.

[#limitations-of-running-jobs-locally]
=== Limitations of running jobs locally

Although running jobs locally with `circleci` is helpful, there are some limitations.

[#executors]
==== Executors

The CLI does not support running jobs that use a xref:executor-intro#linux-vm[machine] (`machine`) or xref:executor-intro#macos[macOS] (`macos`) executor locally. This is because these executors require running an additional virtual machine. Only jobs that use a xref:executor-intro#docker[Docker] (`docker`) executor can be run locally.

[#add-ssh-keys]
==== Add SSH keys

It is currently not possible to add SSH keys using the `add_ssh_keys` CLI command.

[#workflows]
==== Workflows

The CLI tool does not provide support for running workflows. By nature, workflows leverage running jobs concurrently on multiple machines allowing you to achieve faster, more complex builds. Because the CLI is only running on your machine, it can only run single jobs (which make up parts of a workflow).

[#caching-and-online-only-commands]
==== Caching and online-only commands

Caching is not currently supported in local jobs. When you have either a <<configuration-reference#savecache,`save_cache`>> or <</configuration-reference#restorecache,`restore_cache`>> step in your config, `circleci` will skip them and display a warning.

Further, not all commands may work on your local machine as they do online. For example, the Golang build reference above runs a <<configuration-reference#storeartifacts,`store_artifacts`>> step, however, local builds will not upload artifacts. If a step is not available on a local build you will see an error in the console.

[#environment-variables]
==== Environment variables

For security reasons, encrypted environment variables configured in the link:https://app.circleci.com/[web application] will not be imported into local builds. As an alternative, you can specify environment variables to the CLI with the `-e` flag. See the output of the following command for more information.

[,shell]
----
circleci help build
----

If you have multiple environment variables, you must use the flag for each variable, for example:

[,shell]
----
circleci build -e VAR1=FOO -e VAR2=BAR
----

[#test-splitting]
== Test splitting

The CircleCI CLI is used for some advanced features during job runs, for example xref:use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests#[test splitting] for build time optimization.

[#context-management]
== Context management

xref:contexts#[Contexts] provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. While contexts have been traditionally managed on the CircleCI web application, the CircleCI CLI provides an alternative method for managing the usage of contexts in your projects. With the CLI, you can execute several context-oriented commands:

- `create` - Create a new context
- `delete` - Delete the named context
- `list` - List all contexts
- `remove-secret` - Remove an environment variable from the named context
- `show` - Show a context
- `store-secret` - Store a new environment variable in the named context

The above list are "sub-commands" in the CLI, which would be executed like so:

[,shell]
----
circleci context create --org-id <org-id> <context-name> [flags]
----

Refer to the link:https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_context.html[CLI docs] for full details for each command. Many commands require that you include additional information as indicated by parameters delimited by `< >`. For example, when running `circleci context create`, you will need to provide a name for the context and your org ID.

{% include snippets/find-organization-id.adoc %}

[#config-policy-management]
== Config policy management

The CircleCI CLI can be used to manage config policies for your projects. Config policies allow you to enforce best practices and standards across your organization.

For full details on creating, testing, and managing config policies for your organization, including how-to guides, see the xref:config-policy-management-overview#[Manage config policies] section.
