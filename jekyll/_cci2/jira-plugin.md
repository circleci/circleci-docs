## Viewing build and deploy statuses in Jira
{: #viewing-build-and-deploy-statuses-in-jira }

With CircleCI orbs it is possible to display your build and deploy status
in Jira Cloud. To do this, you will need to:

1. Make sure you followed the steps above to connect Jira Cloud with CircleCI.
1. Make sure that you are using version `2.1` at the top of your `.circleci/config.yml` file.
1. To get an API token for build information retrieval, go to [User Settings > Tokens](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens) and create a token. Copy the token. (*Note*: older versions of the Jira orb may require you to retrieve a _Project API Token_, which is accessible from **Project Settings > API Permissions**)
1. To give the integration access to the key, go to **Project Settings -> Environment Variables** and add a variable named _CIRCLE_TOKEN_ with the value being the token you just made.
1. Add the Jira orb to your configuration and invoke it (see example below).

The example config below provides a bare `config.yml` illustrating the use of the Jira Orb.


```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs: # adds orbs to your configuration
  jira: circleci/jira@1.0.5 # invokes the Jira orb, making its commands accessible
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - build:
          post-steps:
            - jira/notify # Runs the Jira's "notify" commands after a build has finished its steps.
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: 'cimg/base:stable'
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - run: echo "hello"
```
