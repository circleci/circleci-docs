The JVM heap size is configurable for the following containers: `frontend`, `test-results`, `output-processing` and `contexts-service`. You might want to consider increasing the heap size if you see "out of memory" errors, such as: `Terminating due to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`.

== Setting up

To be able to configure the JVM_HEAP_SIZE value for each container, you will first need to create customizations files on your services machine.

1. Create customizations files:
+
```sh
/etc/circleconfig/frontend/customizations
/etc/circleconfig/test-results/customizations
/etc/circleconfig/output-processor/customizations
/etc/circleconfig/contexts-service/customizations
```

2. In each customization file add the line below to export your desired JVM heap size:
+
```sh
export JVM_HEAP_SIZE=2g
```

3. Stop and restart CircleCI application from the Management Console dashboard (for example, your-circleci-hostname.com:8800)


== Verify customization is applied
Once your installation has successfully restarted, you can confirm the configured value was applied correctly by running the following REPL commands per container:


* `frontend`
+
```sh
sudo docker exec -it frontend lein repl :connect 6005
```
* `test-results`
+
```sh
sudo docker exec -it test-results lein repl :connect 2719
```
* `output-processing`
+
```sh
sudo docker exec -it picard-output-processor lein repl :connect 6007
```

And following are the outputs you should see:

```clojure
(System/getenv "JVM_HEAP_SIZE") ;; should return what you have set above
```
```clojure
(-> (java.lang.Runtime/getRuntime) (.totalMemory)) ;; return value should match with JVM_HEAP_SIZE
```
