## General metrics
{: #general-metrics }

General metrics appear across the Insights experience and can refer to different
entities, depending on the context. For example, the `Runs` metric may refer to a
count of workflow executions or jobs, depending on the context.

| Runs                  | The count of executions in a selected time window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Total Duration        | The sum of execution times for all workflows in a project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| P95 Duration          | The 95th percentile of execution times for an entity in a selected time window (i.e. 95% of runs completed in the same or less amount of this time). <br/> _The 95th percentile is a standard measure used to interpret performance data. It provides a measure of max value when outlier or transient values are excluded._ |
| P50 (median) Duration | The median execution time. <br/> _Medians are a better measure of central tendency than arithmetic means because they are more resilient to_ skewness _in datasets_.                                                                                                                                                         |

| Success Rate          | The percentage of runs that completed successfully, calculated by `100 x (Successful Runs / All Runs)`                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Organization-level metrics

Organization-level metrics allow you to analyze your organizationâ€™s performance.

| Term                    | Definition     |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Workflow Runs | The count of all workflows executions for an organization for the selected projects in the selected time frame. |
| Total Workflow Duration | The total execution time of all workflows runs for an organization within the selected projects and time frame. |
| Total Credits | The total credits consumed across all selected projects in an organization. |
| Overall Success Rate | The percentage of runs that completed successfully across all runs in the selected projects and workflows. (calculated by `100 x (All Successful Runs/ All Runs)`) |

| Term                    | Definition     |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Time to Recovery | Total time spent in a failed state before a successful execution. |
| Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)| The average time it takes to get back to a successful execution from a failed one (Calculated by `total recovery time / # of failures`). <br> _If there are no failed builds (and thus no recoveries) in the current time window, the MTTR value will be empty. Empty MTTR values will be treated as 0 when calculating Trends._ |
| Throughput | The average (mean) number of builds of any status per day. Calculated by `Sum of builds/ # of days.` |

## Trends
{: #trends }

Raw metric values are often difficult to interpret on their own. Trends provide
additional context to Insights metrics by presenting a relative benchmark
against previous performance. For instance, on the last 7-day view, trends will
display the change in value or delta compared to the prior 7-day window.

**Please note that trends are available only for 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day time windows.**

Trends are calculated as `100 * (current value - previous value) / prior-value`.

### Approximate Trends
{: #approximate-trends }

For percentile metrics like duration, approximation methods are used to find the prior window benchmarks.

#### Duration
{: #duration }
{:.no_toc}

**P95 Duration**

For P95 duration, trends data is calculated by using the worst-case performance
of the previous time window as a benchmark.

For example, to calculate the last 7-day trend information, Insights selects the
worst/largest daily P95 duration of the previous 7 days as a benchmark. For the
last 24-hour trends, Insights selects the worst hourly P95 of the previous 24
hours as a benchmark.

**P50 Duration**

For P50 duration, Trends compares current duration with the median performance
of the prior time window. For example, the last 30-day trends for P50 duration
are calculated by taking the median of the daily P50 values as a benchmark.


### Representations of trend data
{: #representations-of-trend-data }


This section describes how your trend data may appear across various metrics.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/insights_trend_data.png)

- **Green**: The metric is trending in the right direction.
- **Red**: The metric is trending in the wrong direction.
- **Grey**: A trend in either direction is not right or wrong.

Red and Green are used when describing the `Success Rate`, `Throughput` and `MTTR` metrics. Grey arrows are used when describing `Runs`, `Duration` and `Total Credits`

**Percentages**

Percentages are used to indicates the relative percentage change for a metric in
the selected time window compared to the prior window. For instance, if the
success rate of a workflow in the last 7 days has increased to 60% from 40% in
the prior 7 days, Trends displays the +50% change in the current time window.

**Multiples**

Multiples are used to indicate large swings in relative change over the selected
period.

**Arrows**

Trend arrows with no values are used to indicate that the previous time window
contains zero executions or no data.

**No Trend Data**

Empty trend values indicate that there has been no change in data between the
two periods.
