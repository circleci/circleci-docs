[#set-up-sumo-logic-metrics-using-circleci-webhooks]
== Set up Sumo Logic metrics using CircleCI webhooks

To begin collecting and visualizing data with Sumo Logic, first configure CircleCI webhooks to send metrics data to Sumo Logic.

[#configure-webhooks]
=== Configure webhooks

[#step-1-configure-hosted-collector]
==== 1. Configure hosted collector

Follow the Sumo Logic documentation for link:https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors/Configure-a-Hosted-Collector[Configuring a Hosted Collector].

[#step-2-add-an-http-source]
==== 2. Add an HTTP source

To get the URL where the CircleCI webhooks will be sent and recorded to the collector, link:https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source[add an HTTP Source].

When complete, copy the generated “HTTP Source Address”. You can always get this link from Sumo Logic again in the future. This is the URL that will need to be entered in the **Webhooks** section of the CircleCI web app in the next step.

[#step-3-configure-project-webhooks]
==== 3. Configure project webhooks

Complete the following steps to set up a CircleCI webhook to forward your logs to Sumo Logic.

. Log in to the link:https://app.circleci.com/projects[CircleCI web app].

. Access one of your CircleCI projects.

. Open **Project settings**.

. In the project settings sidebar, click **Webhooks**.

. Select **Add webhook**.

. Complete the following fields:
** **Webhook name**: `Sumo Logic CI Visibility` or any other identifier name that you want to provide.
** **Receiver URL**: Use the `HTTP Source Address` you copied in the last section.
** **Events**: Select **Workflow Completed** and **Job Completed**.
** Enable the check: **Certificate verifications**.

. Select **Add Webhook** to save the new webhook.

[#install-the-circleci-app-for-sumo-logic]
=== Install the CircleCI App for Sumo Logic

Now that you have set up collection, install the Sumo Logic App for CircleCI to use pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your CI/CD pipeline.

. Select *App Catalog*.
. In the *Search Apps* field, run a search for your desired app, then select it.
. Click *Install App*.
. Click *Next* in the *Setup Data* section.
. In the *Configure* section of your respective app, complete the following fields.
    .. *Field Name*. If you already have collectors and sources setup, select the configured metadata field name (eg _sourcecategory) or specify other custom metadata (eg: _collector) along with its metadata *Field Value* .
. Click *Next*. You will be redirected to the *Preview & Done* section.


Once the app is installed, it will appear in your Installed Apps folder. Panels will start to fill automatically.

NOTE: Each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results will not be available, but will update with full graphs and charts over time.
