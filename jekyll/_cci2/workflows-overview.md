- NOT RUN: Workflow was never started
- CANCELLED: Workflow was cancelled before it finished
- FAILING: A Job in the workflow has failed
- FAILED: One or more jobs in the workflow failed
- SUCCESS: All jobs in the workflow completed successfully
- ON HOLD: A job in the workflow is waiting for approval
- NEEDS SETUP: A workflow stanza is not included or is incorrect in the `config.yml` file for this project
