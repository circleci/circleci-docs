:page-description: Learn CircleCI releases for visibility into Kubernetes and Amazon SageMaker releases, how it works, and how to get set up
:icons: font
:experimental:

Visualise and control your deployments with CircleCI releases. Deployments to Kubernetes and Amazon SageMaker are supported.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI releases gives you visibility into your Kubernetes deployments within the CircleCI web app, as well as access to commands and visualisations for release management. From the CircleCI web app, you can:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

We support link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] for progressive delivery. Currently the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#canary[canary deployment strategy] is supported, but in a future release link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#blue-green[blue-green] will also be supported. Some further controls are available for projects that use Argo Rollouts:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

To get set up with releases for Amazon SageMaker, refer to the xref:../deploy-to-amazon-sagemaker#[Deploy to Amazon SageMaker] page.

[#how-it-works]
== How it works

CircleCI integrates with your Kubernetes cluster to give you visibility and control over your release process through the CircleCI web app. We currently support Kubernetes Deployments and Argo Rollouts.

Configure environment integrations to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes clusters. Configure the release agent to only monitor the namespaces you require.

Developers can monitor releases in the CircleCI web app, and run commands to manage those releases from the UI. Commands are monitored by CircleCI and relayed to the release agent, which then runs the commands for you.

[#releases-concepts]
== Concepts

The sections below explain some key software delivery concepts. Understanding these concepts will help you take full advantage of CircleCI's release features.

[#component]
=== Component

A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit. In Kubernetes terms, this would be a Deployment or Rollout object along with the related objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, etc. that share a common `circleci.com/component-name` label.

[#delivery]
=== Delivery

_Delivery_ is the act of packaging code changes and making them available for Deployment. Continuous delivery is the prerequisite step for continuous deployment. With some variations on the technologies being used, the delivery process creates executables from code and then makes them available from a repository to be deployed to an environment at a subsequent time.

[#deployment]
=== Deployment

_Deployment_ is the act of putting a new component version into an environment, regardless of whether users and other services interact with the new version or a previous one. Depending on the deployment type, a release may happen as a later task (such as switching over traffic shaping rules for a blue/green deployment) or as a direct consequence of the deployment (such as a standard Kubernetes rolling update).

[#command]
=== Command

A _command_ is a user-initiated action CircleCI performs on the user's behalf to manipulate a specific component. These actions are run asynchronously via our release agent and the results are reported back to the CircleCI web app where you can see them in the releases dashboard, similar to how step output works for CI jobs.

Some commands are available for all components. These are:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

A subset of commands are available for _progressive_ releases (when using Argo Rollouts). These are:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

[#release]
=== Release

A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services.

A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

In the releases dashboard, releases are tagged as **Progressive** if they refer to an Argo Rollout.

A release starts when the component version is updated, and ends when the new version has reached 100% availability, and all associated validations have been completed. In the case of a progressive release, this happens when the Rollout completes. In the case of a Deployment, this happens when the Deployment replicas are all available and ready.

[#the-releases-UI]
== The releases UI

The CircleCI releases UI is a powerful tool for visualising, monitoring and managing your releases. The pages included in the releases UI are described below.

[#dashboard]
=== The dashboard

image::../../img/docs/releases/dashboard.png[Screenshot showing the releases dashboard in the CircleCI web app]

Select **Releases** in the CircleCI web app sidebar to enter the releases dashboard. The dashboard shows the following:

* **Timeline**: A timeline of releases across your organization's components and environments. You can use the filter drop downs at the top to select a component and/or environment. Information you see here includes live status updates, release trigger source, release version, release type (for example, _progressive_, when you are using an Argo Rollout). From here you can access:
** The release details page for a specific release by clicking on the status badge or version number.
** The component or environment details pages by clicking on the respective names.
** The project dashboard for the CircleCI project associated with a release.
** The job details page in the CircleCI web app for the deployment job that kicked off the release.
** The commit details page in your VCS for the commit that started the deployment.

* **Environments**: List of environment integrations set up for your organization. From here you can:
** Set up a new environment integration by selecting btn:[Create Environment Integration].
** Access settings for each environment (icon:cog[]).
** Access the environment details view by selecting an environment name.

* **Components**: A list of components and their associated projects. From here you can:
** Set up a new component by selecting btn:[Create Component]. From here you can select and environment that has a successful environment integration set up, and from there you can add a new component.
** Get straight to the component's project building on CircleCI by selecting the project name.
** Access setting for each component (icon:cog[]).

[#release-status]
== Release status

A release can be in one of the following states:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Status
|Notes

|RUNNING
|The release is currently in progress

|FAILED
|Resources have reached an unhealthy status (pods for the new version of a Kubernetes component)

|SUCCESS
|The Deployment or Rollout has all desired resources available (all pods specified by a Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout)

|CANCELLED
|The release has been cancelled, either using the `cancel release` option, or by being superseded by another release

|EXPIRED
|Release commands failed to be picked up by the release agent within the required time window
|===

== Release markers

Release markers provide a lightweight way to log your releases without requiring a full CircleCI releases setup. With release markers you can log all new releases in one place and link back to the CI/CD pipelines that caused them. You can use release markers independently, without installing the release agent. For setup information, see the xref:configure-release-markers#[Configure release markers] page.

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* Restarting the release agent while a release is ongoing will cause the release agent to lose track of the release status and fail to update the CircleCI services accordingly.
* **In the CircleCI releases UI it is currently possible for you to attempt and restore a version that does not exist**. All releases are presented in the UI, including those outside of the scope of any version history limits you might have set. We do not currently filter out releases for which there is no longer any data.
+
Depending on your setup, you will have options for configuring revision history limits: `revisionHistoryLimit` for Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts, and `$HELM_MAX_HISTORY` for Helm.
+
If you have these limits set, you can not restore a version outside the limit. For example, if your limit is set to the last 10 releases, you can not restore the 11th deployment back.
+
We are working on updates to:
+
** Indicate out-of-scope releases
** Prevent you from attempting to restore unavailable releases
** Provide a manual way for you to mark releases as unavailable
