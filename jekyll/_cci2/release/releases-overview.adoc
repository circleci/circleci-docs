:page-description: Learn CircleCI releases for visibility into Kubernetes releases, how it works, and how to get set up
:icons: font
:experimental:

NOTE: CircleCI releases is currently in **open preview**. During open preview release features are available for free. Charges will be associated with release features once they are generally available.

Visualise and control deployments to your Kubernetes cluster with CircleCI release environments.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI release environments give you visibility into your Kubernetes deployments in the CircleCI web app, as well as access to commands for release management. From the CircleCI web app, you can:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

We support link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] for progressive delivery. Currently the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#canary[canary deployment strategy] is supported, but in a future release link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#blue-green[blue-green] will also be supported. Some further controls are available for projects that use Argo Rollouts:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

If you want to get started with CircleCI releases right away, you can jump to:

* xref:set-up-a-release-environment.adoc#[Tutorial 1: Set up a release environment]
* xref:configure-your-kubernetes-components.adoc#[Tutorial 2: Configure your Kubernetes components]
* xref:manage-releases#[How-to: Manage releases]

[#how-it-works]
== How it works

CircleCI integrates with your Kubernetes cluster to give you visibility and control over your release process through the CircleCI web app. We currently support Kubernetes Deployments and Argo Rollouts.

image::../../img/docs/releases/releases-architecture.png[Diagram showing the architecture of CircleCI releases]

Configure a release environment to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster. Configure the release agent to only monitor the namespaces you require.

Developers can monitor releases in the CircleCI web app, and run commands to manage those releases from the UI. Commands are monitored by CircleCI and relayed to the release agent, which then runs the commands for you.

[#releases-concepts]
== Concepts

The following sections describe concepts that will help you fully understand your release environment, and how releases fit with your CI/CD pipeline.

[#component]
=== Component

A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit. In Kubernetes terms, this would be a Deployment or Rollout object along with the related objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, etc. that share a common `app` label.

[#delivery]
=== Delivery

_Delivery_ is the act of packaging code changes and making them available for Deployment. Continuous delivery is the prerequisite step for continuous deployment. With some variations on the technologies being used, the delivery process creates executables from code and then makes them available from a repository to be deployed to an environment at a subsequent time.

[#deployment]
=== Deployment

_Deployment_ is the act of putting a new component version into a particular environment, regardless of whether users and other services immediately interact with the new version or a previous one. Depending on the type of deployment, a release may happen as a later task (such as switching over traffic shaping rules for a blue/green deployment) or as a direct consequence of the deployment (such as a standard Kubernetes rolling update).

[#command]
=== Command

A _command_ is a user-initiated action CircleCI performs on the user's behalf to manipulate a specific component. These actions are run asynchronously via our release agent and the results are reported back to the CircleCI web app where you can see them in the releases dashboard, similar to how step output works for CI jobs.

Some commands are available for all components. These are:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

A subset of commands are available for _progressive_ releases (when using Argo Rollouts). These are:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

[#release]
=== Release

A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services.

A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

In the releases dashboard, releases are tagged as **Progressive** if they refer to an Argo Rollout.

A release starts when the component version is updated, and ends when the new version has reached 100% availability, and all associated validations have been completed. In the case of a progressive release, this happens when the Rollout completes. In the case of a Deployment, this happens when the Deployment replicas are all available and ready.

[#release-status]
== Release status

Releases can be in one of the following states:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Status
|Notes

|RUNNING
|The release is currently in progress

|FAILED
|Resources have reached an unhealthy status (pods for the new version of a Kubernetes component)

|SUCCESS
|The Deployment or Rollout has all desired resources available (all pods specified by a Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout)

|CANCELLED
|The release has been cancelled, either using the `cancel release` option, or by being superseded by another release

|EXPIRED
|Release commands failed to be picked up by the release agent within the required time window
|===

[#coming-soon]
== Coming soon

A number of features and improvements are planned to be added through open preview and beyond:

* Display release environment details in the CircleCI web app
* Guided release environment setup experience in the CircleCI web app
* link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/bluegreen/[Blue Green] deployments via Argo Rollouts
* Connect releases to your CircleCI workflows
* Display Argo Rollouts analysis run details in the CircleCI web app
* Improved searching and filtering on the release dashboard

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* Restarting the release agent while a release is ongoing will cause the release agent to lose track of the release status and fail to update the CircleCI services accordingly.
