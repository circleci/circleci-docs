:page-description: Learn CircleCI releases for visibility into Kubernetes and Amazon SageMaker releases, how it works, and how to get set up
:icons: font
:experimental:

Visualise and control your deployments with CircleCI releases. Deployments to Kubernetes and Amazon SageMaker are supported.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI releases gives you visibility into your Kubernetes deployments within the CircleCI web app, as well as access to commands and visualisations for release management. From the CircleCI web app, you can:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

We support link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] for progressive delivery. Currently the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#canary[canary deployment strategy] is supported, but in a future release link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#blue-green[blue-green] will also be supported. Some further controls are available for projects that use Argo Rollouts:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

If you want to get started with CircleCI releases for Kubernetes right away, you can jump to:

* xref:set-up-circleci-releases#[Tutorial 1: Set up CircleCI releases]
* xref:configure-your-kubernetes-components#[Tutorial 2: Configure your Kubernetes components]
* xref:manage-releases#[How-to: Manage releases]

To get set up with releases for Amazon SageMaker, refer to the xref:../deploy-to-amazon-sagemaker#[Deploy to Amazon SageMaker] page.

[#how-it-works]
== How it works

CircleCI integrates with your Kubernetes cluster to give you visibility and control over your release process through the CircleCI web app. We currently support Kubernetes Deployments and Argo Rollouts.

image::../../img/docs/releases/releases-architecture.png[Diagram showing the architecture of CircleCI releases]

Configure environment integrations to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes clusters. Configure the release agent to only monitor the namespaces you require.

Developers can monitor releases in the CircleCI web app, and run commands to manage those releases from the UI. Commands are monitored by CircleCI and relayed to the release agent, which then runs the commands for you.

[#releases-concepts]
== Concepts

The sections below explain some key software delivery concepts. Understanding these concepts will help you take full advantage of CircleCI's release features.

[#component]
=== Component

A _component_ in CircleCI is a collection of code and configuration that is deployed and released as a single unit. In Kubernetes terms, this would be a Deployment or Rollout object along with the related objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, etc. that share a common `circleci.com/component-name` label.

[#delivery]
=== Delivery

_Delivery_ is the act of packaging code changes and making them available for Deployment. Continuous delivery is the prerequisite step for continuous deployment. With some variations on the technologies being used, the delivery process creates executables from code and then makes them available from a repository to be deployed to an environment at a subsequent time.

[#deployment]
=== Deployment

_Deployment_ is the act of putting a new component version into an environment, regardless of whether users and other services interact with the new version or a previous one. Depending on the deployment type, a release may happen as a later task (such as switching over traffic shaping rules for a blue/green deployment) or as a direct consequence of the deployment (such as a standard Kubernetes rolling update).

[#command]
=== Command

A _command_ is a user-initiated action CircleCI performs on the user's behalf to manipulate a specific component. These actions are run asynchronously via our release agent and the results are reported back to the CircleCI web app where you can see them in the releases dashboard, similar to how step output works for CI jobs.

Some commands are available for all components. These are:

* Restore version
* Scale component
* Restart component

A subset of commands are available for _progressive_ releases (when using Argo Rollouts). These are:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release

[#release]
=== Release

A _release_ is the act of updating a component to a new version in a specific environment, causing it to become available to an audience of users and other services.

A release can happen when an existing component is updated or when the first version for a new component is deployed.

In the releases dashboard, releases are tagged as **Progressive** if they refer to an Argo Rollout.

A release starts when the component version is updated, and ends when the new version has reached 100% availability, and all associated validations have been completed. In the case of a progressive release, this happens when the Rollout completes. In the case of a Deployment, this happens when the Deployment replicas are all available and ready.

[#the-releases-UI]
== The releases UI

The CircleCI releases UI is a powerful tool for visualising, monitoring and managing your releases. The pages included in the releases UI are described below.

[#dashboard]
=== The dashboard

image::../../img/docs/releases/dashboard.png[Screenshot showing the releases dashboard in the CircleCI web app]

Select **Releases** in the CircleCI web app sidebar to enter the releases dashboard. The dashboard shows the following:

* **Timeline**: A timeline of releases across your organization's components and environments. You can use the filter drop downs at the top to select a component and/or environment. Information you see here includes live status updates, release trigger source, release version, release type (for example, _progressive_, when you are using an Argo Rollout). From here you can access:
** The release details page for a specific release by clicking on the status badge or version number.
** The component or environment details pages by clicking on the respective names.
** The project dashboard for the CircleCI project associated with a release.
** The job details page in the CircleCI web app for the deployment job that kicked off the release.
** The commit details page in your VCS for the commit that started the deployment.

* **Environments**: List of environment integrations set up for your organization. From here you can:
** Set up a new environment integration by selecting btn:[Create Environment Integration].
** Access settings for each environment (icon:cog[]).
** Access the environment details view by selecting an environment name.

* **Components**: A list of components and their associated projects. From here you can:
** Set up a new component by selecting btn:[Create Component]. From here you can select and environment that has a successful environment integration set up, and from there you can add a new component.
** Get straight to the component's project building on CircleCI by selecting the project name.
** Access setting for each component (icon:cog[]).

=== Filter and group components and environments with labels

Add labels to your components and environments to provide teams with a way to filter and group content in the releases UI. Once a label is added, you can use this to filter your view to focus on the content relevant to your team.

Labels are composed of two values separated by a colon, for example, `team:my-team-name`. To specify multiple labels for a component or environment, you can separate them with a comma. For example, `team:my-team-name, role:web`. You can add up to 20 labels to a component or environment.

==== Use labels to filter components and environments

Once you have added labels to your components and environments, you can use them to filter your view in the releases UI. In the timeline, environments, or components view, select a filter to reduce the content in the tab to only your selection. You can also use the label filter dropdown menu at the top of the page.

==== Add or edit labels

To add or edit labels follow the steps below.

== Autodetected releases and release markers

CircleCI automatically generates release markers for your deployment pipelines. Release markers provide a lightweight way to log your releases without requiring a full CircleCI releases setup. Release markers create for you a log of all releases in one place, for a clear overview of what has changed, without the need to search through your CI/CD pipelines. Release markers log all new releases in one place and link back to the CI/CD pipelines that caused them. You can use release markers independently, without installing the release agent.

=== Autodetection of releases

CircleCI looks for the word `deploy` in your job names to detect when a release may have happened and creates an autodetected release marker.

When CircleCI creates a release marker for you automatically, we use the information available in your pipeline configuration to create the following:

* **Component**: CircelCI created a component for the release and uses your project name to create a component name.
* **Environment integration**: CircleCI creates an enviornment for you, using your job and workflow names to attempt to create a relevant name. If an environment name can not be generated, the name will be `autogenerated`, and you can edit it later. The environment has the type `AUTODETECTED`.
* **Release version**: CircleCI uses the build number to populate the release version for the purposes of displaying the release in the CircleCI web app.

If any of the following conditions are true, CircleCI **will not** generate a release marker for a job even if the name contains the word `deploy`:

* The job has a status other than `SUCCESS`.
* Any of the following keywords and keyword combinations are present in the job name:
** `dry run`
** `skip deploy`
** `bypass deploy`
** `deployed`
** `validation`
** `validate`
* The project related to the job has releases created via the Kubernetes release agent or manual release jobs in the last two months.
* You have opted out of the autodetected releases feature.
* The detected environment integration name collides with an integration you have already set up.

==== Manual configuration of autodetected releases
Some points to consider when manually configuring autodetected releases:

* If you decide you would like to manually configure a release marker for an environment integration that was created as part of an autodetected release, refer to the xref:configure-release-markers#[Configure release markers] page to set up a release marker and a new environment integration.

* If you change a component name that was originaly autodetected by us, CircleCI creates a new component and the history **will not** carry over. If you do not update the component name, the history **will** carry over.

* If your environment integration has an autogenerated name, you can edit the name as follows:
.. In the link:https://circleci.com/app/home[CircleCI web app], select your organization.
.. Select **Releases** in the sidebar.
.. Select the **Environments** tab.
.. Find your environment and select cog icon (icon:cog[]) to enter the environment integration settings page.
.. Select **Edit**.
.. Enter a new name and select btn:[Update].


=== Opt out of autodetected releases
If you do not want CircleCI to automatically create release marker for you, you can opt out of this feature either for a whole organization or per-project.

To opt out of autodetected releases for an entire **organization**, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://circleci.com/app/home[CircleCI web app], select your organization.
. Select **Organization settings** in the sidebar.
. Select **Releases**.
. Toggle the "Enable automatic release marker detection" option left. You will see a confirmation message in the bottom right hand corner of the app. To re-enable the feature, toggle the option right.

To opt out of autodetected releases for a **project**, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://circleci.com/app/home[CircleCI web app], select your organization.
. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project in the list, select the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]), select **Project Settings**.
. Select **Releases**.
. Toggle the "Enable automatic release marker detection" option left. You will see a confirmation message in the bottom right hand corner of the app. To re-enable the feature, toggle the option right.

=== Manual setup of release markers

If you would rather set up release markers yourself, see the xref:configure-release-markers#[Configure release markers] page.

[#release-status]
== Release status

A release can be in one of the following states:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Status
|Notes

|RUNNING
|The release is currently in progress.

|FAILED
|Resources have reached an unhealthy status (pods for the new version of a Kubernetes component).

|SUCCESS
|The Deployment or Rollout has all desired resources available (all pods specified by a Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout).

|CANCELLED
|The release has been cancelled, either using the `cancel release` option, or by being superseded by another release.

|EXPIRED
|Release commands failed to be picked up by the release agent within the required time window.

|LOGGED
|Release has been logged using a release marker and is available in the CircleCI releases UI.
|===

[#known-limitations]
== Known limitations

* Restarting the release agent while a release is ongoing will cause the release agent to lose track of the release status and fail to update the CircleCI services accordingly.
* **In the CircleCI releases UI it is currently possible for you to attempt and restore a version that does not exist**. All releases are presented in the UI, including those outside of the scope of any version history limits you might have set. We do not currently filter out releases for which there is no longer any data.
+
Depending on your setup, you will have options for configuring revision history limits: `revisionHistoryLimit` for Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts, and `$HELM_MAX_HISTORY` for Helm.
+
If you have these limits set, you can not restore a version outside the limit. For example, if your limit is set to the last 10 releases, you can not restore the 11th deployment back.
+
We are working on updates to:
+
** Indicate out-of-scope releases
** Prevent you from attempting to restore unavailable releases
** Provide a manual way for you to mark releases as unavailable
