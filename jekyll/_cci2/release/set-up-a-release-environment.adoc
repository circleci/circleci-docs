:page-description: Tutorial outlining how to set up a new CircleCI release environment and install the CircleCI release agent.
:icons: font
:experimental:

NOTE: CircleCI releases is currently in **open preview**. During open preview release features are available for free. Charges will be associated with release features once they are generally available.

Visualise and control deployments to your Kubernetes cluster with CircleCI release environments. The steps outlined on this page guide you to set up a release environment and install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

In this tutorial you will set up an integration between CircleCI and your Kubernetes cluster. Once configured, release status can be reported to the CircleCI web app, and the following commands can be executed in your cluster by the release agent via controls in the CircleCI UI:

* Restore a version
* Scale a version
* Restart a version
* Retry a release (when using Argo Rollouts)
* Promote a release (when using Argo Rollouts)
* Cancel a release (when using Argo Rollouts)

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

In order to set up a release environment with CircleCI you will need to ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled:

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A Kubernetes cluster
* A project building on CircleCI that deploys to your Kubernetes cluster. See the xref:../create-project#[Create a project] page for steps.
* You must have write access to the project associated with the component being deployed. For full details of roles and permissions for GitLab and GitHub App integrations, see the xref:../roles-and-permissions-overview.adoc#[Roles and permissions overview]. If your integration is through Bitbucket or the GitHub OAuth app, you will need to be an org admin in Bitbucket/GitHub respectively. To find out which GitHub integration you have, see the xref:../github-apps-integration.adoc#[GitHub App integration] page

CircleCI supports Kubernetes, Helm, and Argo Rollouts. The following versions have been tested and proven to work. Older versions may work but are not guaranteed:

[#create-release-environment]
== 1. Create your release environment and token

. In the CircleCI web app, click **Releases** in the sidebar
. Click btn:[Add Release Environment]
. Enter a name for your release environment and click btn:[Create Environment]
. Click to select the environment you just created
. Click btn:[Create New Token] and click btn:[Create Token]
. The new token will be displayed. Be sure to copy and save this somewhere for use in the next step. Then click btn:[Done]

[#add-release-agent]
== 2. Add the release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

Use Helm to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

. Add the link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[CircleCI release agent Helm repository] by running the following command:
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo add release-agent https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent
----

. Then, update your local Helm chart repository cache
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo update
----

[#install-the-release-agent]
== 3. Install the release agent

Install the Helm chart to integrate CircleCI's release agent into your Kubernetes cluster. Be sure to substitute the token you created in the previous step, and also, if required, include a list of Kubernetes namespaces you want to monitor.

If you only want to monitor the `default` namespace, you do not need to supply a list with `--set manageNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"`. The `default` namespace is monitored by default. If you struggle to pass the `manageNamespaces` value, try enclosing the array value or the whole parameter itself in a string, with double or single quotes.

[,shell]
----
helm upgrade --install circleci-release-agent-system release-agent/circleci-release-agent \
--set tokenSecret.token=[YOUR_CCI_INTEGRATION_TOKEN] --create-namespace \
--namespace circleci-release-agent-system \
--set manageNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"
----

NOTE: You can further customize the agent installation and check all available options link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[here].

Once you have run this command, you can check your environment is set up by navigating to the environment details page to check the "last used" date has been populated:

. Click btn:[Releases] in the CircleCI web app sidebar
. Click btn:[Configure Environments] at the top left
. Click on the name of your release environment to view the environment details page
