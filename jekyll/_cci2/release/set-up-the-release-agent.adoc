:page-description: Tutorial outlining how to set up CircleCI releases, covering creating an environment integration, installing the release agent and creating components.
:icons: font
:experimental:

This tutorial shows how to manually install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster. This is an alternative to using the in-app releases set up process as described in the xref:set-up-circleci-releases#[Set up CircleCI releases] page.

== Prerequisites

Before setting up the CircleCI release agent in your Kubernetes cluster, check you meet the following prerequisites:

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A Kubernetes cluster
* A project building on CircleCI that deploys to your Kubernetes cluster. See the xref:../create-project#[Create a project] page for steps.
* You must have write access to the project associated with the component being deployed. For full details of roles and permissions for GitLab and GitHub App integrations, see the xref:../roles-and-permissions-overview.adoc#[Roles and permissions overview]. If your integration is through Bitbucket or the GitHub OAuth app, you will need to be an org admin in Bitbucket/GitHub respectively. To find out which GitHub integration you have, see the xref:../github-apps-integration.adoc#[GitHub App integration] page.
* An environment integration set up in the CircleCI web app for your deployment. See the xref:set-up-circleci-releases#[Set up CircleCI releases] page for steps.

== 1. Add the release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

Use Helm to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

. Add the link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[CircleCI release agent Helm repository] by running the following command:
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo add release-agent https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent
----

. Then, update your local Helm chart repository cache
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo update
----

[#install-the-release-agent]
== 2. Install the release agent

Install the Helm chart to integrate CircleCI's release agent into your Kubernetes cluster.

You will need a `CCI_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` for the next step.
. Navigate to the `Environments` tab.
. Select the `gear` icon corresponding to the environment you just created to enter the `Environment Integration Settings` page.
. Select btn:[Create Integration Token] and then btn:[Create Token]
. The new token will be displayed. Be sure to copy and save this somewhere for use in the next step. Then select btn:[Done]

If required, include a list of Kubernetes namespaces you want to monitor. If you only want to monitor the `default` namespace, you do not need to supply a list with `--set manageNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"`. The `default` namespace is monitored by default. If you struggle to pass the `manageNamespaces` value, try enclosing the array value or the whole parameter itself in a string, with double or single quotes.

[,shell]
----
helm upgrade --install circleci-release-agent-system release-agent/circleci-release-agent \
--set tokenSecret.token=[YOUR_CCI_INTEGRATION_TOKEN] --create-namespace \
--namespace circleci-release-agent-system \
--set managedNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"
----

NOTE: You can further customize the agent installation and check all available options link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[here].

Once you have run this command, you can check your environment is set up by navigating to the environment details page to check the "last used" date has been populated:

. Select btn:[Releases] in the CircleCI web app sidebar.
. Select btn:[Configure Environments] at the top left of the page.
. Select the name of your release environment to view the environment details page.
