The steps outlined on this page guide you to configure your Kubernetes resources for integration with your release environment.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

In this tutorial you will configure your Kubernetes components, adding labels and annotation, to enable visibility and control over your deployments.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before following the steps below, ensure the release environment is set up. Refer to the xref:set-up-a-release-environment#[Set up a release environment] page.

[#add-required-labels]
== 1. Add required labels and annotation to your Deployment/Rollout

To enable your release to show up on the releases UI in the CircleCI web app, add the following labels and annotation to your Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout:

* Specify the `circleci.com/component-name` and `circleci.com/version` label in the Kubernetes object `Metadata.Labels`
* Specify the `circleci.com/component-name` and `circleci.com/version` label in the Kubernetes object `Spec.Template.Metadata.Labels`
* Add the `circleci.com/project-id` annotation with the value set to your project ID
+
[NOTE]
====
Specify your **project ID** in one of the following ways:

* Use the `$CIRCLE_PROJECT_ID` xref:variables#built-in-environment-variables[built-in environment variable] in a CircleCI pipeline. This way, you can use tools like `envsubst` to substitute the placeholder for the real value.

* Manually copy the value from the project settings page:

. Select **Projects** in the CircleCI web app sidebar and use the search function to find your project
. Select the ellipsis menu next to your project and select btn:[Project Settings]
. Your project ID is available to copy from the overview page
+

====

For example:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    circleci.com/project-id: <your-project-ID>
  labels:
    circleci.com/component-name: example-deployment
    circleci.com/version: 1.0.0
  name: example-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        ...
        circleci.com/component-name: example-deployment
        circleci.com/version: 1.0.0
----

NOTE: Do not add `circleci.com/version` and `circleci.com/component-name` to the selector labels. These labels can not be changed later, and `circleci.com//version` should change for every new release.

[WARNING]
====
If you were using the release agent prior to version `1.2.0` you were using `app` and `version` in place of `circleci.com/component-name` and `circleci.com/version`. While `app` and `version` are still supported, we recommend to migrate to the new labels as soon as possible.

Support for the old labels will be dropped in one of the next releases.

After migrating to the new labels, rolling back to versions that used the old labels will be supported only for deployments and rollouts managed through Helm.
====

Once you have updated your Deployment or Rollout, check the CircleCI releases dashboard and you should see your release in the timeline view.

[#link-release]
== 2. Link release to deployment job trigger (optional)

You can link your release with the CircleCI _deployment_ job that triggered it. To do this, add the following annotations to your Deployment/Rollout. The method for incorporating these values and variables will depend on your configuration and tooling:

* `circleci.com/job-number` should be set to the `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM` xref:../variables#built-in-environment-variables[environment variable].
* `circleci.com/pipeline-id` should be set to the `pipeline.id` xref:../variables#pipeline-values[pipeline value].
* `circleci.com/workflow-id` should be set to the `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` xref:../variables#built-in-environment-variables[environment variable].

Once these values and variables are rendered, the configuration will look something like:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    circleci.com/job-number: "1"
    circleci.com/pipeline-id: 88dfee99-0348-407f-b113-dbf270cad093
    circleci.com/workflow-id: 5b8c4de8-fd5f-4be2-80a4-3d0c03fc138c
----

[#configure-release-management]
== 3. Configure release management (optional)

By adding annotations to your Kubernetes objects (Deployment/Rollout), you can enable additional actions on your releases dashboard, including the ability to restore, scale, and restart component versions.

[#helm-rollback]
=== a. Use Helm rollback

CAUTION: This option is only available when using Helm to configure your Kubernetes resources.

By default the built-in logic for Kubernetes Deployments or Argo Rollouts is used for the restore version feature. If you manage your component with Helm, you can choose to use the Helm rollback strategy instead. To do so, add the `circleci.com/helm-revision-number` annotation to the Kubernetes object metadata in your Helm chart template:

{% raw %}
[,yaml]
----
annotations:
  circleci.com/helm-revision-number: {{ .Release.Revision | quote }}
----
{% endraw %}

[#operation-timeout]
=== b. Custom operation timeout

CAUTION: This option is only available when using Helm to configure your Kubernetes resources.

The `circleci.com/operation-timeout` annotation allows a custom timeout to be specified for Helm Rollback operations performed as part of a Restore Version command. Valid values are link:https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration[Go duration strings] (for example, 5m, 10m15s). This option is available if you are using Helm to manage your Kubernetes resources.

For example,

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    ...
    circleci.com/operation-timeout: 10m
----

[#opt-out-ui-based-actions]
=== c. Opt out of UI-based actions

All UI-based release management features are **enabled** by default, no action is required to enable them.

If you would like to disable any release management features for a specific component, you can do so by adding any of the following annotations with the value `false` to the related Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout. If an annotation is either not specified or is specified with any value _other_ than `false`, the associated feature is **enabled**.

* `circleci.com/restore-version-enabled` toggles the restore version feature on the annotated Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout
* `circleci.com/scale-component-enabled` toggles the scale component feature on the annotated Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout
* `circleci.com/restart-component-enabled` toggles the restart component feature on the annotated Kubernetes Deployment or Argo Rollout
* `circleci.com/retry-release-enabled` toggles the retry release feature on the annotated Argo Rollout
* `circleci.com/promote-release-enabled` toggles the promote release feature on the annotated Argo Rollout
* `circleci.com/cancel-release-enabled` toggles the cancel release feature on the annotated Argo Rollout

In the following example, all features are explicitly disabled for the annotated Deployment:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: Demo
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    circleci.com/restore-version-enabled: false
    circleci.com/scale-component-enabled: false
    circleci.com/restart-component-enabled: false
    circleci.com/retry-release-enabled: false
    circleci.com/promote-release-enabled: false
    circleci.com/cancel-release-enabled: false
----

[#example-deployment]
== Example deployment

The following snippet shows an example deployment with all required labels and annotations. In this example the btn:[Cancel Release] option in the UI has been disabled.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    circleci.com/cancel-release-enabled: "false"
    circleci.com/helm-revision-number: "1"
    circleci.com/job-number: "1"
    circleci.com/operation-timeout: 30m
    circleci.com/pipeline-id: 88dfee99-0348-407f-b113-dbf270cad093
    circleci.com/project-id: 9da0c100-3295-49a4-827f-7892f3e8dc83
    circleci.com/workflow-id: 5b8c4de8-fd5f-4be2-80a4-3d0c03fc138c
  labels:
    circleci.com/component-name: example-deployment
    circleci.com/version: 1.0.0
  name: example-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-deployment
        circleci.com/component-name: example-deployment
        circleci.com/version: 1.0.0
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-deployment
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
