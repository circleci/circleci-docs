NOTE: CircleCI releases is currently in **open preview**. During open preview release features are available for free. Charges will be associated with release features once they are generally available.

The steps outlined on this page guide you through the tasks required to manage your releases.

[#prerequisites]

Before following the steps below, ensure the release environment has been set up and configured successfully. Refer to the xref:set-up-a-release-environment#[Set up a release environment] and xref:configure-your-kubernetes-components#[Configure your Kubernetes components] pages for more information.

[#restore-version]
== Restore version

The _restore version_ command restores a previously released version of a component.

[#restore-steps]
=== Steps

NOTE: The steps outlined here are to revert a release from the release details page in the CircleCI web app. Is it also possible to run this command from the releases timeline, using the restore release icon in the **Actions** column.

. You are now in the timeline view. Select your component from the dropdown menu
. Scroll to locate the version your want to restore, and click on the version number to enter the release details page
. Click to open the ellipsis menu at the top right of the page (icon:ellipsis-h[]) and click **Restore Version**
. Read through the recommendations in the popup, and if you want to proceed type `RESTORE`, then click btn:[Restore]. We recommend reverting the associated changes in your source repository as soon as possible after using this command

[,shell]
----
kubectl argo rollouts undo <rollout-name> --to-revision=<revision_number>
----
