:page-description: How to guide for managing releases from the CircleCI web app
:icons: font
:experimental:

The steps outlined on this page guide you through the tasks required to manage your releases.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before following the steps below, ensure the release environment has been set up and configured successfully. Refer to the xref:set-up-a-release-environment#[Set up a release environment] and xref:configure-your-kubernetes-components#[Configure your Kubernetes components] pages for more information.

[#restore-version]
== Restore version

The _restore version_ command restores a previously released version of a component.

[#restore-steps]
=== Steps

NOTE: The steps outlined here are to revert a release from the release dashboard in the CircleCI web app. Is it also possible to run this command from a release details page. Select a release number to view a release details page.

. Select btn:[Releases] in the CircleCI web app sidebar
. You are now in the timeline view. Select your component from the dropdown menu
. Scroll to locate the version your want to restore, and select the "Restore release" icon in the **Actions** column
. Read through the recommendations in the popup, and if you want to proceed type `RESTORE`, then select btn:[Restore]. We recommend reverting the associated changes in your source repository as soon as possible after using this command

[#restore-notes]
=== Notes

Executing the _restore version_ command from the CircleCI web app is the equivalent of using the following:

* If you are using Helm (Helm opt-in instructions are xref:configure-your-kubernetes-components#helm-rollback[here]):
+
[,shell]
----
helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number> -n <namespace>
----
* If you are using Argo Rollouts and **not** Helm:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl argo rollouts undo <rollout-name> --to-revision=<revision_number>
----
+
If `revision_number` is not supplied the component will be rolled back to the previous revision
* For a Kubernetes Deployment:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> -n <namespace> --to-revision=<revision-number>
----


[#scale-component]
