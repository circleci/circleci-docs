This tutorial shows how to add a release marker step to your workflow config. Release markers allow you log all new releases in one place and link back to the CI/CD pipelines that caused them.

Release markers provide a lightweight way to log your releases without requiring a full CircleCI releases setup. You can use release markers independently, without installing the release agent. If you are interested in comprehensive release visibility and management features, refer to the xref:set-up-circleci-releases#[Set up CircleCI releases] guide for more information.


== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A CircleCI project with a workflow configured to deploy your code.

== 1. Create environment integration

Before adding a release marker step to your workflow, you will need to create a new environment integration in the CircleCI Releases UI.

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Releases** in the sidebar.
. If this is your first environment setup, select btn:[Create your first Environment Integration]. If you already have environments set up, choose the **Environments** tab and select btn:[Create Environment Integration].
. Enter a name for your environment, and a description if you would like.
. Use the dropdown menu to choose your environment integration type, then select btn:[Next: Release Agent Setup]. **You do not need to continue with installing a release agent at this point**, but you will need to reference this environment integration name as part of your config when adding the `log release` step below.

== 2. Update configuration

Next you will update your CircleCI configuration file. Add a `circleci run log release` command to your deployment job. This tells CircleCI to log the release marker in the Releases UI.

Add a `log release` step at the end of your _deployment_ job, for example:

[,yml]
----
jobs:
  deploy-my-service:
    executor: some-executor
    steps:
      ...
      (existing deployment commands)
      ...
      - circleci run release log --environment-name=<some-environment-name> --component-name=<some-component-name> --target-version=<some-version-name>
----

Substitute the placeholders above based on your application's details:

** The `environment-name` parameter should match the name of your environment integration created via the CircleCI UI.
** The `component-name` parameter sets the name that will be displayed in the CircleCI UI.
** The `target-version` parameter should match the name of the version being released.
** (Optional) You can provide the following parameter if required:
*** The `namespace` param can be provided to use a value other than `default`.

== Conclusion

By following the steps in this guide, you have added a release marker to your CircleCI configuration. You can now view a log of releases in the CircleCI releases UI.
