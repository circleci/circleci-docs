== Introduction

CircleCI Server v{serverversion} is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that you can install on your GCP or AWS Kubernetes cluster.

The core of the CircleCI Server application runs inside Kubernetes.

The application exposes five services using load balancers, three of these load balancers are VPC-internal.

| Load Balancer
| Type
| Ports
| Description

| Front-end GUI Proxy
| External
| 80 and 443
| Exposes the web application.

| Front-end API
| External
| 80 and 443
| Exposes the web application.

| Nomad Control Plane
| Internal
| 4647
| Exposes an RPC protocol for Nomad runners.

| Output Processor
| Internal
| 8585
| Ingests output from Nomad runners.

| VM Service
| Internal
| 3000
| Provisions virtual machines.
|===

CircleCI Server schedules CI jobs using the https://www.nomadproject.io/[Nomad] scheduler. The Nomad control plane runs inside of Kubernetes, while the
Nomad clients, which are responsible for running scheduled CircleCI jobs, are provisioned outside the cluster. CircleCI
Server can run Docker jobs on the Nomad clients themselves or in a dedicated virtual machine (VM).

Job artifacts and output are sent directly from jobs in Nomad to object storage (S3, GCS, or other supported options).
Audit logs and other items from the application are also stored in object storage so both the Kubernetes cluster and the
Nomad clients need access to object storage.

https://kots.io/[KOTs] is used to configure and deploy CircleCI Server 3.0.

== Architecture
Below is a diagram describing the architecture of Server 3.x. The available services
are described in greater detail in the <<Services>> section.

|===
| Service
| Component
| Description
| What happens if it fails?
| Notes

| api-service
| App Core
| Provides a GraphQL API that provides much of the data to render the web frontend.
| Many parts of the UI (e.g. Contexts) will fail completely.
|

| audit-log-service
| App Core
| Persists audit log events to blob storage for long term storage.
| Some events may not be recorded.
|

| builds-service
| App Core
| Ingests from www-api and sends to plans-service, workflows-conductor, and to orbs-service
|
|

| circle-legacy-dispatcher
| Execution
| Part of Compute Management. Sends to usage Q (mongo) and back to VCS.
|
|

| circleci-mongodb
| Execution
| Primary datastore
|
|

| circleci-postgres
| Data storage for microservices
|
|
|

| circleci-rabbitmq
| Pipelines and Execution
| Queuing for workflow messaging, test-results, usage, crons, output, notifications, and scheduler
|
|

| circleci-redis
| Execution
| Cache data that will not be stored permanently (i.e. build logs), for request caching, and for rate limit calculations.
| A failed cache can end up resulting in rate limiting from the VCS if too many calls are made to it.
|

| circleci-telegraf
|
| Telegraf collects statsd metrics. All white-boxed metrics in our services publish statsd metrics that are sent to telegraf,
but can also be configured to be exported to other places (i.e. Datadog or local-observability-stack-prometheus)
|
|

| circleci-vault
|
| HashiCorp Vault to run encryption and decryption as a service for secrets
|
|

| config
|
|
|
|

| contexts-service
| App Core
| Stores and provides encrypted contexts.
| All builds using Contexts will fail.
|

| cron-service
| Pipelines
| Triggers scheduled workflows.
| Scheduled workflows will not run.
|

| dispatcher
| Execution
| Split jobs into tasks and send them to scheduler to run.
| No jobs will be sent to Nomad, the run queue will increase in size but there should be no meaningful loss of data.
|

| domain-service
| App Core
| Stores and provides information about our domain model. Works with permissions and API
| Workflows will fail to start and some REST API calls may fail causing 500 errors in the CircleCI UI. 	If LDAP authentication is in use, all logins will fail.
|

| exim
|
| Will be removed in GA, but users can provide mail submission credentials to an existing MTA
| No email notifications will be sent.
|

| federations-service
| App Core
| Stores user identities (LDAP). API and permissions-service
| If LDAP authentication is in use, all logins will fail and some REST API calls might fail.
| LDAP integration not available

| frontend
| Frontend
| CircleCI web app and www-api proxy.
| The UI and REST API will be unavailable and no jobs will be triggered by GitHub/Enterprise. Running builds will be OK but no updates will be seen.
|

| inject-bottoken
|
| A Kubernetes job that inserts a "bot token" into MongoDB. Bot tokens are authorization interservice communication.		Mainly for www-api
|
|

| kotsadm-kots
| Licensing
| The main Kots application. Runs the Kots admin console where upgrades and configuration of server take place	No admin console available.
| No upgrades or configuration possible for Server
|

| kotsadm-migrations
| Licensing
| Performs database migrations to handle updates of Kotsadm
|
|

| kotsadm-minio
| Licensing
| Object storage for Kots licensing
|
|

| kotsadm-operator
| Licensing
| Deploys and controls Kotsadm
|
|

| kotsadm-postgres
| Licensing
| Database for Kots licensing
|
|

| legacy-notifier
| App Core
| Handles notifications to external services (Slack, email, etc.)
|
|

| local-observability-stack-grafana
| Server
| Used for dashboarding and monitoring
|
|

| local-observability-stack-loki
| Server
| Used for log aggregation
|
|

| local-observability-stack-prometheus
| Server
| Used for metrics
|
|

| local-observability-stack-promtail
| Server
| Used to aggregate logs in a Loki instance.
| Log aggregation will fail. Loki won't contain any container logs.
|

| orb-service
| Pipelines
| Handles communication between orb registry and config.
|
|

| output-processor
| Execution
| Receives job output & status updates and writes them to MongoDB. Also provides an API to running jobs to access caches, workspaces, store caches, workspaces, artifacts, & test results.
|
|

| permissions-service
| App Core
| Provides the CircleCI permissions interface.
| Workflows will fail to start and some REST API calls may fail, causing 500 errors in the UI.
|

| scheduler
| Execution
| Runs tasks sent to it. Works with Nomad server.
| No jobs will be sent to Nomad, the run queue will increase in size but there should be no meaningful loss of data.
|

| server-troubleshooter
| Data
| Runs commands inside pods and appends output to support bundles.
|
| May not be available in GA.

| slanger
| Server
| Provides real-time events to the CircleCI app.
| Live UI updates will stop but hard refreshes will still work.
|

| test-results
| Execution
| Parses test result files and stores data.
| There will be no test failure or timing data for jobs, but this will be back-filled once the service is restarted.
|

| vm-gc
| Compute Management
| Periodically check for stale machine and remote Docker instances and request that vm-service remove them.
| Old vm-service instances might not be destroyed until this service is restarted.
|

| vm-scaler
| Machine
| Periodically requests that vm-service provision more instances for running machine and remote Docker jobs.
| VM instances for machine and Remote Docker might not be provisioned causing you to run out of capacity to run jobs with these executors.
| Different overlay for EKS vs. GKE.

| vm-service
| Machine
| Inventory of available vm-service instances, and provisioning of new instances.
| Jobs that use machine or remote Docker will fail.
|

| workflows-conductor-event-consumer
| Pipelines
| Takes in information from VCS to kick off pipelines.
| New Pipelines will not be kicked off when there are changes in the VCS.
|

| workflows-conductor-grpc-handler
| Pipelines
| Helps translate the information through gRPC.
|
|

| web-ui-*
| Frontend
| Micro Front End (MFE) services used to render the frontend web application GUI.
| The respective services page will fail to load. Example: A web-ui-server-admin failure means the Server Admin page will fail to load.
| The MFE's are used to render the web application located at app.<my domain here>
