== Introduction

CircleCI Server v{serverversion} is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that you can install on your GCP or AWS Kubernetes cluster.

The core of the CircleCI Server application runs inside Kubernetes.

The application exposes four services using load balancers, three of these load balancers are VPC-internal.

CircleCI Server schedules CI jobs using the https://www.nomadproject.io/[Nomad] scheduler. The Nomad control plane runs inside of Kubernetes, while the
Nomad clients, which are responsible for running scheduled CircleCI jobs, are provisioned outside the cluster. CircleCI
Server can run Docker jobs on the Nomad clients themselves or in a dedicated virtual machine (VM).

Job artifacts and output are sent directly from jobs in Nomad to object storage (S3, GCS, or other supported options).
Audit logs and other items from the application are also stored in object storage so both the Kubernetes cluster and the
Nomad clients need access to object storage.

https://kots.io/[KOTs] is used to configure and deploy CircleCI Server 3.0.
