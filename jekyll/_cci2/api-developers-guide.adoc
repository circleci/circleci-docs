:page-description: API guide for internal and external CircleCI developers
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-layout: classic-docs
:page-liquid:

This guide was written to assist developers in quickly and easily making API calls to CircleCI services to return detailed information about users, pipelines, projects, and workflows. The API v2 Specification itself may be viewed in the https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/[Reference documentation].

[#api-categories]
== API categories

The current categories of API v2 endpoints are:

{% include snippets/api-v2-endpoints.adoc %}

NOTE: Currently, xref:managing-api-tokens#creating-a-personal-api-token[Personal API tokens] are the only supported tokens on API v2. xref:managing-api-tokens#creating-a-project-api-token[Project tokens] are not currently supported on API v2.

[#authentication-and-authorization]
== Authentication and authorization

The CircleCI API utilizes token-based authentication to manage access to the API server and validate that a user has permission to make API requests. Before you can make an API request, you must first add an API token and then verify that you are authenticated by the API server to make requests. The process to add an API token and have the API server authenticate you is described in the next section.

You can use the token in the request header with the name `Circle-Token`, as shown in the examples below. You may also use the API token as the username (Base64-encoded) with HTTP Basic Authentication.

[#using-the-api-securely-wtih-curl]
=== Using the API securely with cURL

CircleCI encourages security best practices when using cURL with the API. Visit the xref:security-recommendations#protect-the-api-token[Security recommendations] page to learn how to mitigate risks and protect your API token and secrets.

[#add-an-api-token]
=== Add an API token

To add an API token, perform the steps listed below.

. Log in to the https://app.circleci.com[CircleCI web application]
. xref:managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token[Create a personal API token] by visiting the link:https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens[Personal API Tokens] page, and follow the steps to add an API token
. To test your token, call the API using the command below. You will need to set your API token as an environment variable before making a cURL call.
+
[,shell]
----
export CIRCLE_TOKEN={your_api_token}
curl https://circleci.com/api/v2/me --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN"
----

. You should see a JSON response similar to the example shown below.
+
[,json]
----
{
  "id": "string",
  "login": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
----

All API calls are made in the same way, by making standard HTTP calls, using JSON, a content-type, and your API token. The JSON examples shown in this document are not comprehensive, and may contain additional JSON response fields not shown in the example, based on user input and fields.

[#accept-header]
=== Accept header

It is recommended that you specify an Accept header in your API requests. The majority
of API endpoints will return JSON by default, but some endpoints (primarily, API
v1) return EDN if no accept header is specified.

* To return formatted JSON, include a `text/plain` header like the example shown below:
+
[,shell]
----
curl --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "Accept: text/plain"    \
  https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline
----

* To return compressed JSON:
+
[,shell]
----
curl --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "Accept: application/json"    \
  https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline
----

[#getting-started-with-the-api]
== Getting started with the API

[#github-and-bitbucket-projects]
=== GitHub OAuth and Bitbucket Cloud projects

[NOTE]
====
*GitHub authorization with CircleCI is changing*. Starting August 2023 when you authorize your CircleCI account with GitHub, you may find this will be done through our GitHub App, rather than the GitHub OAuth app. You can see which account type you have by heading to the CircleCI web app and inspecting the URL in your browser:

This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the *GitHub App*: `+https://app.circleci.com/organization/circleci/UTxCZDiJ9MLGLC8hR1ZDmg+`

This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the *GitHub OAuth app*: `+https://app.circleci.com/github/<your GitHub username>+`

If you authenticated with the *GitHub OAuth app*, this section is relevant to you. For *GitHub App*, refer to the <<gitlab-saas-support-projects,following section>>.
====

If you want to pull information from CircleCI about a GitHub OAuth app repository `\https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli` you can refer to it in API calls as `gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli`, which is a _triplet_ of the VCS type (VCS provider), the name of your engineering organization (or your VCS username), and the name of the repository.

For the VCS type, you can use `github` or `bitbucket` as well as the shorter forms `gh` or `bb`. The `organization` is your username or organization name in your version control system.

With this API, CircleCI introduces a string representation of the triplet called the `project_slug`, which takes the following form:

[,shell]
----
:vcs_type/:org_name/:repo_name
----

The `project_slug` is also included in the response payload when looking up a pipeline or workflow by ID. The `project_slug` can then be used to get information about the project.

image::{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/api-structure.png[API structure]

For GitHub and Bitbucket Cloud projects, `project_slug` is currently usable as a human-readable identifier for a given project. For <<gitlab-saas-support-projects,GitHub App, GitLab and Bitbucket Data Center projects>>, the slug format has been changed.

[#gitlab-saas-support-projects]
=== GitHub App, GitLab and Bitbucket Data Center projects

[NOTE]
====
*GitHub authorization with CircleCI is changing*. Starting August 2023 when you authorize your CircleCI account with GitHub, you may find this will be done through our GitHub App, rather than the GitHub OAuth app. You can see which account type you have by heading to the CircleCI web app and inspecting the URL in your browser:

This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the *GitHub App*: `+https://app.circleci.com/organization/circleci/UTxCZDiJ9MLGLC8hR1ZDmg+`

This style of URL indicates you authenticated with the *GitHub OAuth app*: `+https://app.circleci.com/github/<your GitHub username>+`

If you authenticated with the *GitHub OAuth app*, this section is relevant to you. For *GitHub App*, refer to the <<gitlab-saas-support-projects,following section>>.
====

For GitHub App and GitLab projects, organization as well as project names do not serve as identifiers, and are not part of project slug. These projects currently use a new slug format:

[,shell]
----
circleci/:slug-remainder
----

The project slug can be found by navigating to your project in the CircleCI web app and taking the "triplet" string from the browser address bar.

image::{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/standalone-project-slug.png[GitLab project slug available in address in the web app]

In API requests, the project slug must be passed as a whole. For example:

[,shell]
----
curl --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
  --header "Accept: application/json"    \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/circleci/:slug-remainder
----

The project slugs must be treated as opaque strings. The slug should not be parsed to retrieve the project or organization IDs. To retrieve project and organization IDs or names, use the entire slug to fetch <<get-project-details,project details>> or organization details. The IDs and names are included in the payload.

[#rate-limits]
== Rate limits

The CircleCI API is protected by rate limiting measures to ensure the stability of the system. CircleCI reserves the right to throttle the requests made by an individual user, or the requests made to individual resources in order to ensure a fair level of service to all of our users.

As the author of an API integration with CircleCI, your integration should expect to be throttled, and should be able to gracefully handle failure. There are different protections and limits in place for different parts of the API. In particular, we protect our API against *sudden large bursts of traffic*, and we protect against *sustained high volumes* of requests, for example, frequent polling.

For HTTP APIs, when a request is throttled, you will receive link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429[HTTP status code 429]. If your integration requires that a throttled request is completed, then you should retry these requests after a delay, using an exponential backoff.

In most cases, the HTTP 429 response code will be accompanied by the ;link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After[Retry-After HTTP header]. When this header is present, your integration should wait for the period of time specified by the header value before retrying a request.

To understand the current limit, you can inspect other headers that describe the API limits. These will vary slightly depending on the API call you are making, as different services will impose different limits. The following headers are possible:

* `RateLimit-Limit`: states your rate limit, which will be in seconds, unless an `X-RateLimit-Limit` header exists, in which case _that_ will define the specific time window.
* `X-RateLimit-Limit-<TIME>`: states the limits for the specified time window. `TIME` can be one of `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, or `Day`.

Each `RateLimit-Limit` or `X-RateLimit-Limit` header will also have a related `RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header that will tell you how much of your allotted usage you have remaining for that time period.

Similarly, there are `RateLimit-Reset` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers that will give you the number of seconds until the current rate limit window will reset.

NOTE: As we transition some APIs from one rate limit system to another, a different limit may appear in the `RateLimit` header compared to the `X-RateLimit` header. In these cases, the lower limit will be enforced.

[#example-end-to-end-api-request]
== Example end-to-end API request

The following section details the steps you would need, from start to finish, to make an API call. This section includes creating a demo repository called "hello-world"; however, you can use a pre-existing repository to follow along if you choose.

Many of the API calls make use of the `+{project-slug}+` triplet, described <<getting-started-with-the-api,above>>.

[#prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

* A GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab account with a repository to set up with CircleCI. *GitHub App, GitLab and Bitbucket Data Center users:* Note the <<gitlab-saas-support-projects,change in the definition>> for the project slug references in the examples and use cases on the rest of this document.
* Completion of the CircleCI xref:getting-started#[onboarding].

[#steps]
=== Steps

. On your VCS provider, create a repository. The repository for this example will be called `hello-world`.
. Onboard your new Project on the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] by navigating to menu:Projects[your project > Set Up Project].
 After completing the steps for setting up your project, you should have a valid `config.yml` file in a `.circleci` folder at the root of your repository. In this example, the `.circleci/config.yml` contains the following:
+
[,yaml]
----
# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. See: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference
version: 2.1
# Use a package of configuration called an orb.
orbs:
# Declare a dependency on the node orb
  node: circleci/node@4.7.0
# Orchestrate or schedule a set of jobs
workflows:
# Name the workflow "test_my_app"
  test_my_app:
# Run the node/test job in its own container
    jobs:
      - node/test
----

. Add an API token from the link:https://circleci.com/account/api[Personal API Tokens page]. Be sure to write down and store your API token in a secure place once you generate it.
. It's time to test out your API token using `curl` to make sure everything works. The following code snippets demonstrate querying all pipelines on a project. Note that in the example below, the values within curly braces (`{}`) need to be replaced with values specific to your username/orgname.
+
[,shell]
----
 # First: set your CircleCI token as an environment variable
 export CIRCLE_TOKEN={your_api_token}

 curl --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
   --header "Accept: application/json"    \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline
----
+
You will likely receive a long string of unformatted JSON. After formatting, it should look like so:
+
[,json]
----
 {
   "next_page_token": null,
   "items": [
   {
     "id": "03fcbba0-d847-4c8b-a553-6fdd7854b893",
     "errors": [],
     "project_slug": "gh/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
     "updated_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.517Z",
     "number": 1,
     "state": "created",
     "created_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.517Z",
     "trigger": {
     "received_at": "2020-01-10T19:45:58.489Z",
       "type": "api",
             "actor": {
               "login": "teesloane",
               "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12987958?v=4"
             }
           },
           "vcs": {
             "origin_repository_url": "https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
             "target_repository_url": "https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/hello-world",
             "revision": "ca67134f650e362133e51a9ffdb8e5ddc7fa53a5",
             "provider_name": "GitHub",
             "branch": "master"
       }
     }
     ]
   }
----

. One of the benefits of the CircleCI API v2 is the ability to remotely trigger pipelines with parameters. The following code snippet simply triggers a pipeline via `curl` without any body parameters:
+
[,shell]
----
 curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Accept: application/json" \
 --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
----
+
This returns:
+
[,json]
----
 {
   "number": 2,
   "state": "pending",
   "id": "e411ea74-c64a-4d60-9292-115e782802ed",
   "created_at": "2020-01-15T15:32:36.605Z"
 }
----
+
While this alone can be useful, we want to be able to customize parameters of the pipeline when we send this POST request. By including a body parameter in the `curl` request (via the `-d` flag), we can customize specific attributes of the pipeline when it runs: pipeline parameters, the branch, or the git tag. Below, we are telling the pipelines to trigger for "my-branch":
+
[,shell]
----
 curl -X POST https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Accept: application/json" \
 --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
 -d '{ "branch": "my-branch" }'
----

. Let us move on to a more complex example: triggering a pipeline and passing a parameter that can be dynamically substituted into your configuration. In this example, we will pass a Docker image tag to our `docker` executor key.
 +
First, we will need to modify the `.circleci/config.yml` to be a little more complex than the standard "Hello World" sample provided by the onboarding.
+
[,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: "circleci/node:<< pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>"
    environment:
      IMAGETAG: "<< pipeline.parameters.image-tag >>"
    steps:
      - run: echo "Image tag used was ${IMAGETAG}"
parameters:
  image-tag:
    default: latest
    type: string
----
+
You will need to declare the parameters you expect to receive from the API. In this case, under the `parameters` key, we define an `image-tag` to be expected in the JSON payload of a POST request to the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/triggerPipeline[Trigger a new pipeline] endpoint.
 +

. Now we can run a `curl` request that passes variables in a POST request, similar to the following:
+
[,shell]
----
 curl -u ${CIRCLE_TOKEN}: -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
   "parameters": {
     "image-tag": "4.8.2"
   }
 }' https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/pipeline
----

For more detailed information about other endpoints you may wish to call, refer to the
link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/[CircleCI API v2 Documentation] for an overview of all
endpoints currently available.

[#additional-api-use-cases]
== Additional API use cases

Now that you have a general understanding of how the CircleCI API v2 service works through an end-to-end API example request and walkthrough, let us look at a few common tasks and operations you may perform on a regular basis when using the API.

Before trying any of the API calls in this section, make sure you have a personal API token and have been authenticated to make calls to the server.

[#get-project-details]
=== Get project details

You may often find it helpful to retrieve information about a specific project, including the name of the organization the project belongs to, the version control system (VCS) that hosts the project, and other details. The CircleCI API enables you to return this and other information by making a single GET request to the `+project/{project-slug}+` endpoint by passing the `project-slug` parameter.

[#get-project-steps]
==== Steps

Of the several project-related API endpoints available with CircleCI API v2, making a GET request to the `+/project/{project-slug}+` endpoint enables you to return detailed information about a specific project by passing the `project_slug` parameter with your request.

NOTE: Whenever you see curly brackets `{}`, this represents a variable that you must manually enter in the request.

To return project details, perform the following steps:

. For this GET API call, under the `parameters` key, define the `project_slug` (`\<vcs_type\>/\<org_name\>/\<repo_name\>`) parameter you want returned in the JSON payload in your `curl` request as follows:
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project_slug} \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
----

. After passing the `project-slug` parameter and making the API request, you will receive unformatted JSON text similar to the example shown below.
+
[,json]
----
{
  "slug": "gh/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs",
  "name": "api-preview-docs",
  "organization_name": "CircleCI-Public",
  "vcs_info": {
    "vcs_url": "https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs",
    "provider": "GitHub",
    "default_branch": "master"
  }
}
----

Notice in the example above that you will receive very specific information about your project, including the name of the project, the name of the organization that the project belongs to, and information about the VCS that hosts the project. For a more detailed breakdown of each value returned in this request, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#get-a-project[Get Project Details] section of the _CircleCI API v2 Reference Guide_.

[#get-job-details]
=== Get job details

Much like the Get a project API request described in the previous example, the link:https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/getJobDetails[Get job details] API request enables you to return specific job information from the CircleCI API by making a single API request.

Retrieving job information can be very useful when you want information about how your job performed, what resources were used (for example, pipeline, executor type, etc.), and the time it took for the job to finish.

[#get-job-details-steps]
==== Steps

Of the several jobs-related API endpoints available with CircleCI API v2, there is a specific endpoint you may wish to call to receive detailed information about your job. This API call to the `+GET /project/{project_slug}/job/{job-number}+` endpoint enables you to return detailed information about a specific job by passing the `project-slug` and `job-number` parameters with your request.

NOTE: Whenever you see curly brackets `{}`, this represents a variable that you must manually enter in the request.

To return job details, perform the following steps:

. For this GET API call, under the `parameters` key, define the `project_slug` and `job_number` parameters you want returned in the JSON payload in your `curl` request as follows:
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project_slug}/job/{job_number} \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
----

. After passing the parameters and making the API request, you will receive unformatted JSON text similar to the example shown below.
+
[,json]
----
  {
  "web_url": "string",
  "project": {
    "slug": "gh/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs",
    "name": "api-preview-docs",
    "external_url": "https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs"
  },
  "parallel_runs": [{
    "index": 0,
    "status": "string"
  }],
  "started_at": "2020-01-24T11:33:40Z",
  "latest_workflow": {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "build-and-test"
  },
  "name": "string",
  "executor": {
    "type": "string",
    "resource_class": "string"
  },
  "parallelism": 0,
  "status": null,
  "number": 0,
  "pipeline": {
    "id": "string"
  },
  "duration": 0,
  "created_at": "2020-01-13T18:51:40Z",
  "messages": [{
    "type": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "reason": "string"
  }],
  "contexts": [{
    "name": "string"
  }],
  "organization": {
    "name": "string"
  },
  "queued_at": "2020-01-13T18:51:40Z",
  "stopped_at": "2020-01-13T18:51:40Z"
}
----

Notice in the example above that you will receive very specific information about your job:

* Project and workflow details for the job
* Date and time the job started and finished
* Executor type
* Current status of the job
* Duration of the job.

For a more detailed breakdown of each value returned in this request, refer to the https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#get-job-details[Get job details] section of the API v2 Reference Guide.

[#download-artifacts]
=== Download artifacts

The following section details the steps you need to follow to download artifacts that are generated when a job is run, first, returning a list of artifacts for a job, and then downloading the full set of artifacts. If you are looking for instructions for downloading the _latest_ artifacts for a pipeline, without needing to specify a job number, see our link:{{site.baseurl}}/artifacts/#downloading-all-artifacts-for-a-build-on-circleci[API v1.1 guide] -- keep checking back here as this functionality will be added to API v2 in the future.

[#download-artifacts-steps]
==== Steps

. Ensure your API token is set as an environment variable. You maybe have already done this during authentication, but if not, run the following command in your terminal, substituting your personal API token:
+
[,shell]
----
export CIRCLE_TOKEN={your_api_token}
----

. Retrieve the job number for the job you want to get artifacts for. You can find job numbers in the UI - either in the breadcrumbs on the Job Details page, or in the URL.
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/job-number.png[Job number]

. Next, use the `curl` command to return a list of artifacts for a specific job.
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/{job_number}/artifacts \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN"
----
+
You should get a list of artifacts back - if the job you selected has artifacts associated with it. Here's an extract from the output when requesting artifacts for a job that builds these docs:
+
[,json]
----
{
  "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough6.png",
  "node_index": 0,
  "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough6.png"
},
{
  "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough7.png",
  "node_index": 0,
  "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough7.png"
},
{
  "path": "circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough8.png",
  "node_index": 0,
  "url": "https://53936-48750547-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/circleci-docs/assets/img/docs/walkthrough8.png"
},
----

. Next, you may extend this API call to download the artifacts. Navigate to the location you would like to download the artifacts to, and run the following command, remembering to substitute your own values in the request:
+
[,shell]
----
 curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/{project-slug}/{job_number}/artifacts \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Accept: application/json" \
 --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" \
 | grep -o 'https://[^"]*' \
 | wget --header="Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN" -v -i -
----
+
NOTE: `grep` is used to locate all the URLs for downloading the job artifacts, while `wget` is used to perform the download.

[#gather-insights]
=== Gather insights

The CircleCI API v2 also includes several endpoints that enable you to retrieve detailed insights into your workflows and individual jobs. Read the link:{{site.baseurl}}/insights[Using Insights] page to learn more about insights data.

The example below describes how you can return information about a single workflow containing information about metrics and credit usage.

[#returning-workflow-metrics]
==== Returning workflow metrics

To return aggregated data for an individual workflow, perform the steps listed below.

NOTE: Whenever you see curly brackets `{}`, this represents a variable that you must manually enter in the request.

. For this GET API call, under the `parameters` key, define the `project_slug` in your `curl` request as follows:
+
[,shell]
----
curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/insights/{project-slug}/workflows
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--header "Accept: application/json"
--header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN"
----

. After you have defined the `project-slug` and made the API request, you will receive unformatted JSON text similar to the example shown below.

[,json]
----
{
	"next_page_token": null,
	"items": [{
		"name": "build",
		"metrics": {
			"success_rate": 0.5975609756097561,
			"total_runs": 82,
			"failed_runs": 33,
			"successful_runs": 49,
			"throughput": 11.714285714285714,

Notice that in this JSON response, you will receive detailed metrics for the set of workflows that were run, including:

* `success_rate` - The ratio of successful runs (only those with a "success" status) over the total number of runs (any status) in the aggregation window.
* `total_runs` - The total number of runs that were performed.
* `failed_runs` - The number of runs that failed.
* `successful_runs` - The number of runs that were successful.
* `throughput` - The average number of builds per day.
* `mttr` - The Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). This is the average time it takes, when a CI build fails, to get it back to a "success" status.
* `duration_metrics` - A collection of specific metrics and measurements that provide the duration of the workflow, which includes `min`, `max`, `median`, `mean`, `p95`, and `standard_deviation`.
* `total credits used` - The total number of credits that were used during the build.
* `windows_start & windows_end` - The time the build was initiated, and then completed.

NOTE: The above example only shows a small number of builds. When you run this command, you may receive up to 250 individual builds that you can review in much more detail.

[#reviewing-individual-job-metrics]
==== Reviewing individual job metrics

Now that you have retrieved aggregated data for up to 250 different jobs, you will most likely want to review specific information about a single job, or smaller number of jobs, to ensure that your jobs are running efficiently. To review an individual job, follow the steps below.

. Using your `project-slug` from the previous API call you made to return workflow data, make a GET API call to the following Insights endpoint:
+
[,shell]
----
 curl -X GET https://circleci.com/api/v2/insights/{project-slug}/workflows/builds
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"
 --header "Accept: application/json"
 --header "Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN"
----

. Once you call this Insights endpoint, you will receive a JSON output similar to the example shown below.

The following information is returned for each job:

* `id` - The ID associated with the individual job.
* `status` - The status of the job.
* `duration` - The total time of the job, in seconds.
* `created_at` - The time the job started.
* `stopped_at` - The time the job ended.
* `credits_used` - The number of credits used during the job.
