## Deployment Overview 

It is possible to deploy to any service by adding commands to `.circleci/config.yml` and setting secrets on the Project Settings > Environment Variables page of the CircleCI application. Available deployment targets include Azure, Google (App Engine, Container Engine, and Cloud) and many others. 

Add the `deploy` step to your `config.yml` to set up conditional deployment for your application. The following example uses a bash command to check that the current branch is the `master` branch before running any deploy commands. Without this check, `<your-deploy-commands>` would be executed every time this job is triggered. It is also possible to create a separate job for deploy for this purpose, see [Orchestrating Workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows/) for instructions.

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: my-image
    working_directory: /tmp/my-project
    steps:
      - run: <do-some-stuff>
      - deploy:
          name: Maybe Deploy
          command: |
            if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
              <your-deploy-commands>
            fi
```

The `deploy` step is for deploying artifacts. In a run with parallelism, `deploy` is only executed by node #0 and only if all nodes succeed. Nodes other than #0 will skip this step. The `deploy` step uses the same configuration map and semantics as a `run` step. Jobs may have more than one deploy step.

## AWS Deployment

1. To deploy to AWS from CircleCI 2.0 use the [awscli installation instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) to ensure that `awscli` is installed in your primary container. 

2. Add your AWS credentials to the **Project Settings > AWS Permissions** page in the CircleCI application.
The **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** that you entered are automatically available in your primary build container and exposed as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

3. Add a `deploy` step to your config.yml file that refers to the specific AWS service, in this example it is S3:

```
      - deploy:
          name: Deploy to S3 if tests pass and branch is Master
          command: |
            if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
              aws s3 sync jekyll/_site/docs s3://circle-production-static-site/docs/ --delete
            else
              echo "Not master branch so not deploying"
            fi
```            

To learn more about the `deploy` step, please see the [configuration reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/#deploy).

## Azure

To deploy to Azure, use a similar command to the above example that uses the `deploy` key. If pushing to your repo is required, see the [Adding Read/Write Deployment Keys to GitHub or Bitbucket]( {{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/) section of the Github and Bitbucket Integration document for instructions. Then, configure the Azure Web App to use your production branch. 

## Heroku

The built-in Heroku integration through the CircleCI UI is not implemented for CircleCI 2.0. However, it is possible to deploy to Heroku manually by using a script to set up Heroku, adding SSH keys with the `add_ssh_keys` option and setting the $CIRCLECI_BRANCH environment variable. 

1. Create a script to set up Heroku similar to this example `setup-heroku.sh` file in the `.circleci` folder:
     ```
     #!/bin/bash
     git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/cci-demo-walkthrough.git
     wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/branches/stable/heroku-linux-amd64.tar.gz
     mkdir -p /usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin
     tar -xvzf heroku-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/lib
     ln -s /usr/local/lib/heroku/bin/heroku /usr/local/bin/heroku
     
     cat > ~/.netrc << EOF
     machine api.heroku.com
       login $HEROKU_LOGIN
       password $HEROKU_API_KEY
     machine git.heroku.com
       login $HEROKU_LOGIN
       password $HEROKU_API_KEY
     EOF

     # Add heroku.com to the list of known hosts
     ssh-keyscan -H heroku.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
     ```
This file runs on CircleCI and configures everything Heroku needs to deploy the app. The second part creates a `.netrc` file and populates it with the API key and login details set previously.

2. Install and authorize Heroku for the CircleCI account that owns the project. 

3. Add environment variables for the Heroku API key and login email to the CircleCI application on the Project > Settings > Environment Variables page as shown in the following image:
![Add Environment Variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/walkthrough5.png)

4. Create a new SSH key, without a passphrase, to connect to the Heroku Git server from CircleCI. The private key is added through the SSH Permissions page with a hostname of `git.heroku.com` as shown in the following screenshot:
![Add SSH Key]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/walkthrough6.png)

5. Note down the Fingerprint for the private key for later reference. 

6. Add the public key to Heroku on the <https://dashboard.heroku.com/account> screen.

7. Add `run` and `deploy` steps similar to the following example in your `config.yml` file: 

     ```
     - run: bash .circleci/setup-heroku.sh
     - add_ssh_keys:
         fingerprints:
           - "48:a0:87:54:ca:75:32:12:c6:9e:a2:77:a4:7a:08:a4"
     - deploy:
         name: Deploy Master to Heroku
         command: |
           if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
             git push heroku master
             heroku run python manage.py deploy
             heroku restart
           fi
     ```

Notes on the added keys:

- The new `run:` step executes the `setup-heroku.sh` script.
- The `add_ssh_keys:` adds an installed SSH key with a unique fingerprint.
- The `deploy` section checks if it is on `master` using the `${CIRCLE_BRANCH}` environment variable. If it is, it runs the Heroku deployment commands with every successful build on the master branch. 

Refer to the full example in the [2.0 Project Tutorial]( {{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/project-walkthrough/) for additional details.

## Google Cloud

Ensure that the Google Cloud SDK is installed in your primary container so that `gcloud` and all of the necessary tools for manipulating Kubernetes resources are at your disposal inside your deployment script/commands. In the following example, if the build passes and the current branch was the master branch, CircleCI 
runs `deploy.sh` to do the actual deployment work.

```
     - deploy:
         name: Deploy Master to GKE
         command: |
           if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
             ./deploy.sh
           fi
```

The deployment script pushes the newly created
Docker image out to the registry, then updates the K8s deployment to use the
new image with a `gcloud` command to handle authentication and push the image all at
once: 

```
sudo /opt/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud docker -- push us.gcr.io/${PROJECT_NAME}/hello
```

The new image is now available in GCR for the GCP infrastructure to
access. Then, change permissions:

```
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.kube
```

Finally, utilize the patch subcommand of `kubectl` to find the line that specifies the image to use for our container,
and replaces it with the image tag of the image just built. The K8s deployment
then intelligently upgrades the cluster by shutting down old containers and
starting up-to-date ones.

```
kubectl patch deployment docker-hello-google -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"docker-hello-google","image":"us.gcr.io/circle-ctl-test/hello:'"$CIRCLE_SHA1"'"}]}}}}'

```

The full `deploy.sh` file is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/circleci/docker-hello-google/blob/master/deploy.sh).
