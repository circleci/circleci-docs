NOTE: The config policies feature is available on the **Scale** plan and is currently in **open preview**.

Follow this how-to guide to learn how to create a config policy to restrict which projects can run jobs on a self-hosted runner resource class. For more information about config policies, see the xref:config-policy-management-overview#[Config policies overview].

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Install/update the CircleCI CLI, and ensure you have authenticated with a token before attempting to use the CLI with config policies. See the xref:local-cli#[Installing the Local CLI] page for more information.

* Set up a self-hosted runner. See the xref:runner-overview/#getting-started[Getting started] section of the Self-hosted runners overview.

* Ensure you have **enabled** config policy evaluation for your organization so that project configurations **will** be evaluated against your organization's policies when pipelines are triggered:
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci policy settings --enabled=true --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,shell]
----
{
  "enabled": true
}
----
+
{% include snippets/find-organization-id.adoc %}

[#create-your-policy]
== 1. Create your policy

. If you have not already done so, create an empty directory to store your policies. For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Create a new file in this directory for your new policy. Name the file `runner.rego`.

. Copy the following snippet into the `runner.rego` file you just made:
+
[source,rego]
----
package org
import data.circleci.config

policy_name["runner_policies"]

enable_hard["resource_class_check"]

resource_class_check = config.resource_class_by_project({ "namespace/resource_class": {"project_UUIDs"}})
----
+
In the following steps you will replace `namespace/resource_class` and `project_UUIDs` with one of your self-hosted runner resource classes, and one of your existing projects. The `runner.rego` policy, once uploaded, will then restrict your specified self-hosted runner to only run jobs from your specified project.

[#update-with-your-details]
== 2. Update policy with your details

. Replace `namespace/resource_class` with one of your runner resource classes:
.. In the CircleCI web app, go to your self-hosted runner's inventory page by selecting **Self-Hosted Runners** in the sidebar. If you do not see this option, check that you have accepted the CircleCI Runner Terms and created a namespace and resource class, as outlined in the runner installation guides. Here you will see all your available self-hosted runner resource classes.
.. Replace `namespace/resource_class` in the `runner.rego` file with the name of the resource class that you would like to restrict.

. Replace `project_UUIDs` with a project ID:
.. In the CircleCI web app, navigate to your projects dashboard by selecting **Projects** in the sidebar. Find the project you want to allow to build on your self-hosted runner, and then click the ellipsis (`...`) next to that project and select **Project Settings**.
.. Copy the Project ID from the overview page and replace `project_UUIDs` with this project ID.

[#push-up-your-policy-bundle]
== 3. Push up your policy bundle

Create and upload the policy bundle using CircleCI CLI:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy push ./config-policies –owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

If the upload was successful, you will see something like the following:

[source,shell]
----
{
  “Created”: [“runner_policies”]
}
----

NOTE: If you would like to write tests for your policy, check out the xref:test-config-policies#[Test config policies] guide.

[#a-more-complex-example]
== A more complex example

Once you have this runner restriction policy up and running, you can quickly add more runner resource class/project pairings, and allow multiple projects per runner. To do this you will expand the `resource_class_check` rule.

The following snippet shows two separate runner resource classes (`my-namespace/runner-test1` and `my-namespace/runner-test2`) with allowed projects, the first has two projects in its allowed list.

[source,rego]
----

package org
import data.circleci.config

policy_name["runner_policies"]

enable_hard["resource_class_check"]

resource_class_check = config.resource_class_by_project({
  "my-namespace/runner-test1": {
    "a20ae1c6-d723-4c03-9bb6-01d5b3594e02",
    "2accadd0-c832-489e-b837-4de03def0d35"
  },
  "my-namespace/runner-test2": {
    "637f9136-694e-4105-bb43-1028ffb9043e"
  }
})
