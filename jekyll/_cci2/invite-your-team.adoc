After setting up an organization in CircleCI, invite your team to create and collaborate on projects.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* At least one project created in your organization. See the xref:create-project#[Create a project] page for instructions.

[#invite-team-github-app-gitlab]
== GitHub App and GitLab users

NOTE: These steps are for GitHub App accounts. Refer to the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] to check if your GitHub integration uses the GitHub App or the GitHub OAuth app.

You must be an Organization Admin to invite your team to CircleCI.

. In the CircleCI web app, go to menu:Organization Settings[People], then click btn:[Invite].
. To send out email invites, enter your team members' email addresses, each separated by a space, then assign their role in your CircleCI organization. If you need to assign different roles to different team members, add team members in the **Invite** form based on role.

Once they join your org, you can then also assign each team member a role on an individual project level. See the xref:manage-roles-and-permissions#[Manage roles and permissions guide] for more details.

[#invite-team-github-oauth-bitbucket]
== GitHub OAuth and Bitbucket users

NOTE: These steps are for GitHub OAuth app and Bitbucket accounts. If you use GitHub, refer to the xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app integration] guide to check if your GitHub integration uses the GitHub App or the GitHub OAuth app.

Any user who is already a member of your CircleCI organization may use this process to invite new team members to CircleCI.

. On the **Dashboard** in the CircleCI web app, use the filter dropdown to select a project.
. Click the **Add team members** link next to the project name.
. A modal window will pop up. Click the btn:[Invite my team] button in the window to copy an invite message that you can send to your team members. The sign-up link is _not_ unique to a single team member. This link can be shared and used for multiple users at the same time.
. Your team members will need to use the sign-up link in your invite message to join your organization.

Alternatively, to craft a custom invite link for your organization, follow these steps: 

. In the CircleCI web app, go toÂ menu:Organization Settings[Overview] and copy your **Organization ID**.
. Incorporate your Organization ID and VCS (either GitHub or Bitbucket) into the invitation link using the following format: `\https://app.circleci.com/launchpad/invited?source-button=collaboration-widget&invitePage=launchpad&orgId=[your-organization-id]&vcsType=[github-or-bitbucket]`
. Send this sign-up link to new team members to join your organization.
