NOTE: These steps are for GitLab and GitHub App accounts. Refer to the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page to check if your GitHub integration uses the GitHub App or the GitHub OAuth app. You must be an Organization Admin to invite your team to CircleCI.

. In the CircleCI web app, go to menu:Organization Settings[People], then select btn:[Invite].
. To send out email invites, enter your team members' email addresses. Multiple emails can be separated by a space. Then, assign their role in your CircleCI organization. If you need to assign different roles to different team members, add team members in the Invite form based on role.
. Once they join your org, you can then also assign each team member a role on an individual project level. See the xref:manage-roles-and-permissions#[Manage roles and permissions] page for more details.
