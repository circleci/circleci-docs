* To generate numbered steps (an ordered list) use the following syntax:
+
[source,adoc]
----
. step 1 text
. step 2 test
. step 3 text
----

* To keep numbered steps flowing correctly when code blocks, images or admonitions are used inside steps, use the `+` on the line before the block starts to indicate the block is part of the step above:
+
[source,adoc]
----
  . Step one
  . Step two involves some code
  +
  [source, shell]
  ----
  some code
  ----
  . Step three is still in number order
----

* Use ordered lists for steps in a process. All other lists should be unordered.

* Capitalize the first word of each item in a list.

* If the text in the bullet is a full sentence or completes the intro stem use a period at the end.
