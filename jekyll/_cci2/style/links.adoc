* In markdown content, internal links within docs should use `{{ site.baseurl }}` in order to create relative links. This means when you build docs locally the links will work between local versions rather than taking you to the production docs site:
+
----
[GitHub and Bitbucket Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/gh-bb-integration/
----
+
The equivalent for asciidoc content is:
+
----
[GitHub and Bitbucket Integration]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/gh-bb-integration/)
----

* Links should explicitly name the document or section to which they are linking.
** **Good:** Refer to the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[Setting an environment variable in a project] section of the Environment Variables document. +
** **Bad:** See here for info on https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[adding project-level environment variables].
