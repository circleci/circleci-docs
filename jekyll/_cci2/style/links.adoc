[#cross-references]
== Cross references
* Cross references (links between docs pages) in **.adoc** should be made in the following form:
+
[source,adoc]
----
link:/docs/github-integration#user-keys-and-deploy-keys[User Keys and Deploy Keys]
----

* The **.md** equivalent would be to use a link:
+
[source,md]
----
[User Keys and Deploy Keys](/github-integration#user-keys-and-deploy-keys)
----

* Cross references should explicitly name the document or section to which they are linking.
** **Good:** Refer to the https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[Setting an environment variable in a project] section of the Environment Variables document. +
** **Bad:** See here for info on https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project[adding project-level environment variables].
