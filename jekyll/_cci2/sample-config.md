The CircleCI 2.0 configuration introduces a new key for `version: 2`. This new key enables you to try 2.0 while continuing to build on 1.0. That is, you can still use 1.0 on some projects while using 2.0 on others. New keys for `jobs:` and `steps:` enable greater control and provide a framework for workflows and status on each phase of a run to report more frequent feedback.

The following sections provide a sample `.circleci/config.yml` with an overview of Jobs and Steps, changes to keys from 1.0, new keys that are nested inside Steps and new keys for Workflows. 

## Jobs Overview

Jobs are a collection of Steps. All of the steps in the job are executed in a single unit which consumes a CircleCI container from your plan while it's running.

In 2.0 Jobs can be run using the `machine` executor which enables reuse of recently used `machine` executor runs, or the `docker` executor which can compose Docker containers to run your tests and any services they require, such as databases.

When using the `docker` executor the container images listed under the `docker:` keys specify the containers to start and replace the `machine: services:` stanza from 1.0 configuration.  Any public Docker images can be used with the `docker` executor.

See the [Executor Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/#machine-executor-overview) for more information about the available executors.

## Steps Overview

Steps are a collection of executable commands which are run during a job. The `step:` key replaces the 1.0 `compile:`, `test:`, and `deployment:` keys. Within `steps:`, the `checkout:` key is still required and a new key for `run:` enables addition of arbitrary, multi-line shell command scripting.  In addition to the `run:` key, new keys for `save_cache:`, `restore_cache:`,  `deploy:`, `store_artifacts:`, `store_test_results:` and `add_ssh_keys` are nested under Steps.

## Sample Configuration with Sequential Workflow

Following is a sample 2.0 `.circleci/config.yml` file. 

{% raw %}

  build:
    working_directory: ~/mern-starter
    # The primary container is an instance of the first list image listed. Your build commands run in this container.
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2
    # The secondary container is an instance of the second listed image which is run in a common network where ports exposed on the primary container are available on localhost.   
      - image: mongo:3.4.4
    steps:
      - checkout

          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - run:
          name: Install npm wee

          prefix: tests
      - store_artifacts:
          path: coverage
          prefix: coverage
      
workflows:

  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test:
          requires:

          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
```
{% endraw %}
This example shows a sequential workflow with the `test` job configured to run only on the master branch. Refer to the [Workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows) document for complete details about orchestrating job runs with parallel, sequential, and manual approval workflows.

## Sample Configuration with Fan-in/Fan-out Workflow
Following is a sample configuration for a Fan-in/Fan-out workflow. Refer to [the complete demo repo on GitHub](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-workflows/blob/fan-in-fan-out/.circleci/config.yml) for details.

Note that since a job can only run when its dependencies are satisfied it transitively requires the dependencies of all upstream jobs, this means only the immediate upstream dependencies need to be specified in the `requires:` blocks.

## Sample iOS App Configuration with Code Signing and Crashlytics
In the following example configuration the test steps run with the specified commands.
The code signing is performed with the CircleCI built-in mechanism 
and all successful builds of the app on the `master` branch
will be distributed to Crashlytics:

```

jobs:
  test: # just a label, can be anything
    machine:
      enabled: true
      xcode:
        version: 8.0
      environment:
        # please specify your code signing identity name here
        GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY: "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"
