This document will give you the guidelines for migrating your iOS
project from CircleCI 1.0 to 2.0.

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview

With the release of CircleCI 2.0 for macOS, your iOS projects can now
benefit from the improvements in the CircleCI 2.0 platform, including:

* [Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/): Orchestrate
  jobs and steps with great flexibility using a simple set of new keys
  in your configuration. Increase the development speed through faster
  feedback, shorter reruns, and more efficient use of resources.

* [Advanced caching](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/): Speed up
  builds by caching files from run to run using keys that are easy to
  control with granular caching options for cache save and restore
  points throughout your jobs. Cache any files from run to run using
  keys you can control.

## Example 2.0 iOS Project Configuration

This sample configuration file should work for most iOS projects on
CircleCI 2.0:

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml

# Specify the config version - version 2 is latest.
version: 2

# Define the jobs for the current project.
jobs:
  build-and-test:

    # Specify the Xcode version to use.
    macos:
      xcode: "8.3.3"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output

    # Define the steps required to build the project.
    steps:

      # Get the code from the VCS provider.
      - checkout

      # Download CocoaPods specs via HTTPS (faster than Git)
      # and install CocoaPods.
      - run:
          name: Install CocoaPods
          command: |
            curl https://cocoapods-specs.circleci.com/fetch-cocoapods-repo-from-s3.sh | bash -s cf
            pod install

      # Run tests.
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: fastlane scan
          environment:
            SCAN_DEVICE: iPhone 6
            SCAN_SCHEME: WebTests

      - store_test_results:
          path: output/scan
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output

  deploy:
    macos:
      xcode: "8.3.3"
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output

    steps:
      - checkout

      # Set up code signing via Fastlane Match.
      - run:
          name: Set up code signing
          command: fastlane match development --readonly

      # Build the release version of the app.
      - run:
          name: Build IPA
          command: fastlane gym

      # Store the IPA file in the job's artifacts
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output/MyApp.ipa

      # Deploy!
      - run:
          name: Deploy to App Store
          command: fastlane spaceship

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build-and-test
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
```

## Best Practices

To ensure a consistent build experience, it is best practice to add a
Gemfile and set up code signing with the help of Fastlane Match
before you push a 2.0 `.circleci/config.yml` file to your CircleCI iOS
project.

### Gemfile
{:.no_toc}

We suggest that you add a Gemfile to your iOS project if you don't have
one already. Checking in a Gemfile and using Bundler to install and run
gems ensures that recent versions of Fastlane and CocoaPods are
available in your build.

Following is a sample Gemfile:

```
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'fastlane'
gem 'cocoapods'
```

### Setting up Code Signing With Fastlane Match
{:.no_toc}

Check out our [code signing guide]({{ site.baseurl
}}/2.0/ios-codesigning) for the exact steps for setting up code signing
for your iOS project on CircleCI 2.0.

## Creating the 2.0 Configuration File

The following sections provide examples of 2.0 configuration syntax for an iOS project. CircleCI also provides partial config translation for iOS projects, see [Using the 1.0 to 2.0 config-translation Endpoint]({{ site.baseurl
}}/2.0/config-translation). If your 1.0 project does **not** have a `circle.yml` file, the [CircleCI Config Generator](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-config-generator/blob/master/README.md) provides a script to generate an initial config file from your 1.0 project.

### Job Name and Xcode Version
{:.no_toc}

In the 2.0 `.circleci/config.yml` file the first few lines specify the
name of the job and the Xcode version to use:

```
version: 2
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    macos:
      xcode: "8.3.3"
...
  deploy:
    macos:
      xcode: "8.3.3"
...
```

### Build Steps Key
{:.no_toc}

The top-level `steps` key contains all the build steps that will be run
for a particular job:

```
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    steps:
      - ...
      - ...
```

You can see all the available step types in the [Configuring CircleCI]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/configuration-reference/) document.
**Note:** Docker support is not available in the macOS builds.

### Checking out the Project Code
{:.no_toc}

One of the first items under `steps` will be the code checkout step:

```
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    steps:
      - checkout
```

### Caching Ruby Gems Installed With Bundler
{:.no_toc}

In CircleCI 2.0, cache save and cache restore are based on a _cache
key_. Here is how you can cache the Ruby gems based on the content of
`Gemfile.lock`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    environment:
      BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle  # path to install gems and use for caching
    steps:
      # add other steps here
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
          - v1-gems-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
          # Fall back to using the latest cache if no exact match is found.
          - v1-gems-
      # Install gems.
      - run:
          name: Bundle install
          command: bundle check || bundle install
          environment:
            BUNDLE_JOBS: 4
            BUNDLE_RETRY: 3
      - save_cache:
          key: v1-gems-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
          paths:
            - vendor/bundle
```

{% endraw %}

Every time your Gemfile.lock changes, a new cache will be created.
Please check out [this doc]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/caching/) for
more information about cache keys and other available key options
beyond `checksum`.

### Installing CocoaPods
{:.no_toc}

If you are already checking your [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) _into_
your repository, there is no need to do anything in this stepâ€”your
dependencies will be picked up correctly. However, if you are _not_
including the CocoaPods into the repository, you will need to install
CocoaPods in your `.circleci/config.yml`.

Installing CocoaPods with `pod install` will fetch the whole CocoaPods
specs repo, and that can take some of the valuable build time. To make
`pod install` faster on CircleCI and reduce your build time, CircleCI provides
a cache of CocoaPods specs via HTTPS instead of Git.

Following is an example config snippet that will fetch CocoaPods specs using
HTTPS and then run `pod install`:

{% raw %}
```
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      ...
      - run:
          name: Install CocoaPods
          command: |
            curl https://cocoapods-specs.circleci.com/fetch-cocoapods-repo-from-s3.sh | bash -s cf
            pod install
```
{% endraw %}

See [this CocoaPods
guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control)
for more details on checking your pods into the repo instead of installing them
in your config.

### Running Tests
{:.no_toc}

It is possible to use [Fastlane
Scan](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/scan) to run your
tests as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      # add other steps here
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: bundle exec fastlane scan
          environment:
            SCAN_DEVICE: iPhone 6
            SCAN_SCHEME: WebTests
```

You can replace the `bundle exec fastlane scan` command with your custom
test command, and change the environment variables passed into it. If
your test command spans multiple lines, you can include multiple
commands in a single step:

```
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      ...
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: |
            make build
            make test
```

### Storing Artifacts, Test Results, and Diagnostic Files
{:.no_toc}

CircleCI 2.0 does not automatically collect artifacts in your jobs,
so if your {% comment %} TODO: Job {% endcomment %}build is generating files that you would like to access with
the CircleCI application later on, you must explicitly collect those
files with the `store_artifacts` step.

To view XML test results in the CircleCI application, add a
`store_test_results` step in your `.circleci/config.yml` file.

To save logs as artifacts, use the `store_artifacts` step as shown in
the following example:

```
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      ...
      - store_test_results:
          path: output/scan
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output
```

Find more details about these steps in the
[Artifacts doc]({{ site.baseurl}}/2.0/artifacts/) and the
[Test Metadata doc]({{ site.baseurl}}/2.0/collect-test-data/).

### Deployment Using Workflows
{:.no_toc}

With the availability of Workflows in 2.0, it is best practice to
extract all the commands related to the deployment of the app into
its own job:

```yaml
jobs:
  # add other jobs here
  deploy:
    macos:
      xcode: 8.3.3
    working_directory: /Users/distiller/project
    environment:
      FL_OUTPUT_DIR: output

    steps:
      - checkout

      # Set up code signing via Fastlane Match.
      - run:
          name: Set up code signing
          command: fastlane match development --readonly

      # Build the release version of the app.
      - run:
          name: Build IPA
          command: bundle exec fastlane gym

      # Store the IPA file in the build artifacts
      - store_artifacts:
          path: output/MyApp.ipa
          destination: ipa

      # Deploy!
      - run:
          name: Deploy to App Store
          command: bundle exec fastlane spaceship
```

The previous example deployment job specifies an Xcode version, adds
command to produce the release version, stores it as an artifact, and
submits it to the App Store.

The following snippet adds a Workflows section to the
`.circleci/config.yml` file to specify the conditions that run the
deployment job:

```
version: 2
jobs:
...
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build-and-test
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
```

In the previous example, CircleCI runs the `build-and-test` job on every
push to the repository, and the deploy job will only run on the master
branch after the `build-and-test` job has finished and is successful.

Refer to the [Orchestrating Workflows doc]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/workflows/)
for more examples of using Workflows.

## Example Application on GitHub

See the [`circleci-demo-ios` GitHub repository](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-ios)
