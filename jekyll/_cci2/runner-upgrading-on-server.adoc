= Upgrading the CircleCI's self-hosted runner on server
:page-layout: classic-docs

This page describes how to update the CircleCI's **machine runner** on CircleCI server installations.



[#self-hosted-runner-for-server-compatibility]
== Machine runner on server compatibility

Refer to the individual installation pages for machine runner to find the runner version you need for your platform:

- xref:runner-installation-linux#download-the-launch-agent-script[Linux]
- xref:runner-installation-mac#download-the-launch-agent-script[macOS]
- xref:runner-installation-windows##set-launch-agent-version[Windows]

[#upgrading-self-hosted-runner-on-server]
== Upgrading machine runner on server

Unlike CircleCI cloud, server does not automatically update the `circleci-launch-agent`, and requires manual intervention. The following sections detail how to upgrade machine runners in your server installation across all environments.

[#upgrading-self-hosted-runner-in-a-containerized-environment]
=== Upgrading machine runner in a containerized environment

This section details how to upgrade self-hosted runner in containerized environments: Kubernetes and Docker.

[#upgrading-self-hosted-runner-for-kubernetes]
==== Upgrading machine runner for Kubernetes

Refer to the xref:runner-on-kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes Installation Instructions].

[#upgrading-self-hosted-runner-for-docker]
==== Upgrading machine runner in Docker

. Stop any currently running self-hosted runner containers:
+
```shell
docker stop <container-name>
```
. Remove the self-hosted runner containers:
+
```shell
docker stop <container-name>; docker rm <container-name>;
```
. Start a new machine runner Docker container:
+
```shell
CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS=<resource-class> CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN=<runner-token> agent_version=<agent_version_for_server> docker run --env agent_version --env CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN --env CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS --name <container-name> <image-id-from-previous-step>
```
+
NOTE: When starting the docker container on server, the `agent_version` environment variable will need to be passed in using the `--env` flag.

[#upgrading-self-hosted-runner-in-a-non-containerized-environment]
=== Upgrading machine runner in a non-containerized environment

The process for manually updating the `circleci-launch-agent` binary can be broken down into three steps for non containerized environments. These steps are expanded upon in the sections below.

. Replace existing `circleci-launch-agent` binary with the new version.
. Stop currently running `circleci-launch-agent` processes.
. Start the new version of the `circleci-launch-agent` binary.

[#replace-the-circleci-launch-agent-binary-with-the-new-version]
==== 1. Replace the `circleci-launch-agent-binary` with the new version

Following the same step as in the individual platform installations, update the launch agent version environment variable to the correct version, then save and run the script to download and replace the old binary with the newly updated version.

- xref:runner-installation-linux#download-the-launch-agent-script[Linux]
- xref:runner-installation-mac#download-the-launch-agent-script[macOS]

```shell
export agent_version="<launch-agent-version>" && sh ./download-launch-agent.sh
```

- xref:runner-installation-windows#installation-steps[Windows]
```powershell
$Env:agentVer = "<launch-agent-version>"
```
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
./Install-CircleCIRunner.ps1
```

[#stop-the-currently-running-machine-runner]
==== 2. Stop the currently running machine runner

The currently running `circleci-launch-agent` process will need to be halted before starting the newly updated binary. Platform-specific instructions for this are given below.

[#stopping-the-machine-runner-on-linux]
===== Stopping the machine runner on Linux

Run the following commands:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop circleci.service
sudo systemctl disable circleci.service
```

[#stopping-the-machine-runner-on-mac]
===== Stopping the machine runner on Mac

Run the following commands:

```shell
sudo launchctl unload '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
```

[#stopping-the-machine-runner-on-windows]
===== Stopping the machine runner on Windows

Run the following command:

``` powershell
Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CircleCI Launch Agent"
```

[#start-the-new-machine-runner]
==== 3. Start the new machine runner

Platform-specific instructions are given below.

[#starting-on-linux]
===== Starting on Linux

Run the following commands:

```shell
sudo systemctl reload circleci.service
sudo systemctl enable circleci.service
sudo systemctl start circleci.service
```

[#starting-on-mac]
===== Starting on Mac

Run the following command:

```shell
sudo launchctl load '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
```

[#starting-on-windows]
===== Starting on Windows

Run the following commands:

``` powershell
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CircleCI Launch Agent"
```
