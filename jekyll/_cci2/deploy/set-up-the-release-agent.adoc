:icons: font

This tutorial shows how to manually install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster. This manual installation guide is an alternative to using the in-app releases set up process as described in the xref:set-up-circleci-deploys#[Set up CircleCI releases] page.

== Prerequisites

Before setting up the CircleCI release agent in your Kubernetes cluster, check you have an environment integration set up in the CircleCI web app for your deployment. See the xref:set-up-circleci-deploys#[Set up CircleCI releases] page for steps and prerequisites.

== 1. Add the release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

Use Helm to install the CircleCI release agent into your Kubernetes cluster

. Add the link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[CircleCI release agent Helm repository] by running the following command:
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo add release-agent https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent
----

. Then, update your local Helm chart repository cache
+
[,shell]
----
helm repo update
----

== 2. Create an integration token

You will need a `CCI_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` to install the CircleCI release agent into your cluster. To create an integration token, follow these steps:

. In the CircleCI web app, select **Releases** in the sidebar.
. Navigate to the **Environments** tab.
. Select the gear icon (icon:cog[]) corresponding to the environment you just created to enter the Environment Integration Settings page.
. Select btn:[Create Integration Token] and then btn:[Create Token]
. The new token will be displayed. Be sure to copy and save this somewhere for use in the next step. Then select btn:[Done]

== 2. Install the release agent

Use the following command to install the Helm chart to integrate CircleCI's release agent into your Kubernetes cluster.

If required, you can include a list of Kubernetes namespaces you want to monitor. If you only want to monitor the `default` namespace, you do not need to supply a list with `--set manageNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"`. The `default` namespace is monitored by default. If you struggle to pass the `manageNamespaces` value, try enclosing the array value or the whole parameter itself in a string, with double or single quotes.

[,shell]
----
helm upgrade --install circleci-release-agent-system release-agent/circleci-release-agent \
--set tokenSecret.token=[YOUR_CCI_INTEGRATION_TOKEN] --create-namespace \
--namespace circleci-release-agent-system \
--set managedNamespaces="{namespace1,namespace2}"
----

NOTE: You can further customize the agent installation and check all available options link:https://circleci-public.github.io/cci-k8s-release-agent/[here].

Once you have run this command, you can check your environment is set up by navigating to the environment details page to check the "last used" date has been populated. It navigate to the environment details page, follow these steps:

. Select **Releases** in the CircleCI web app sidebar.
. Select the **Environments** tab.
. Select the name of your environment integration to view the environment details page.
