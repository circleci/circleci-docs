== Prerequisites

Before performing a rollback by workflow rerun, ensure you have:

* *Deploy markers configured*. You must configure deploy markers in your CircleCI workflows. Deploy markers track when deployments occur and are essential for rollback functionality. Follow the Configure Deploy Markers guide to set this up.

== Performing a rollback by workflow rerun

Workflow rerun rollbacks are the simplest form of rollback where you do not need to set up any additional configuration. To perform a rollback using workflow rerun:

. Navigate to the Project Overview page.
. Select btn:[Rollback].
. Select btn:[Rollback by workflow re-run].

This will open the workflow re-run modal with the following options:

* *Choose a version*. Select the version you want to roll back to from the list of available versions.
* *Confirm rollback*. Select btn:[Next], confirm rollback to proceed.

The workflow that originally deployed the selected version will be re-run, effectively performing a rollback to that version.

=== Important considerations

* *Advantage*: No setup required. This rollback method works immediately after configuring deploy markers.
* *Disadvantage*: The entire workflow will be re-run, which may not always be desirable depending on your workflow complexity and duration
* For complete control over the rollback process and to avoid re-running entire workflows, consider using the custom rollback pipeline approach described in the Setting Up Rollbacks in CircleCI section.
