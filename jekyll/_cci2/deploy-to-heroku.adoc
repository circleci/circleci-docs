In this how-to guide, you will learn how to configure CircleCI to deploy to Heroku.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

link:https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku] is a popular platform for hosting applications in the cloud. To configure CircleCI to deploy your application to Heroku, follow the steps below.

== Deploy with the Heroku orb

[#create-account]
=== 1. Create an account

Create a Heroku account and follow the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/start[Getting Started on Heroku] documentation to set up a project in your chosen language.

[#create-env-vars]
=== 2. Create environment variables

Add the name of your Heroku application and your Heroku API key as environment variables as `HEROKU_APP_NAME` and `HEROKU_API_KEY`, respectively. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

[#deploy-with-orb]
=== 3. Deploy with the Heroku orb

Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[Heroku orb] to keep your configuration simple. The `deploy-via-git` installs the Heroku CLI in the primary container, runs any pre deployment steps you define, deploys your application, then runs any post-deployment steps you define. See the Heroku orb page in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[orbs registry] for full details of parameters and options:

{% include snippets/add-version-number.adoc %}

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  heroku: circleci/heroku@x.y
workflows:
  heroku_deploy:
    jobs:
      - heroku/deploy-via-git:
          post-steps:
            - run: your-database-migration-command #example of a post-deployment step
          pre-steps:
            - run: command-that-run-before-deploying #example of a pre-deployment step

```

For more detailed information about these Heroku orbs, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[CircleCI Heroku Orb].

== Heroku deployment with 2.0 configuration

[#create-account-2]
=== 1. Create an account

Create a Heroku account and follow the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/start[Getting Started on Heroku] documentation to set up a project in your chosen language.

[#create-env-vars-2]
=== 2. Create environment variables

Add the name of your Heroku application and your Heroku API key as environment variables as `HEROKU_APP_NAME` and `HEROKU_API_KEY`, respectively. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

[#create-deploy-job]
=== 3. Create deploy job

In your `.circleci/config.yml`, create a `deploy` job and add an xref:executor-intro#[executor type].

[#add-steps-deploy-job]
=== 4. Add steps to your deploy job

Add `steps` to your `deploy` job to checkout and deploy your code. You can specify which branch you would like to deploy. The example below specifies the main branch, and deploys using a `git push` command.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
    steps:
      - checkout
    # build job ommitted for brevity
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Deploy Main to Heroku
          command: |
            git push https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git main

workflows:
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build # only run deploy-via-git job if the build job has completed
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main # only run deploy-via-git job on main branch
```

NOTE: Heroku provides the option "Wait for CI to pass before deploy" under deploy / automatic deploys. See the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys[Heroku documentation] for details.
