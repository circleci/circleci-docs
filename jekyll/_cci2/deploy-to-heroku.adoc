link:https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku] is a popular platform for hosting applications in the cloud. To configure CircleCI to deploy your application to Heroku, follow the steps below.

== Deploy with the Heroku orb

. Create a Heroku account and follow the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/start[Getting Started on Heroku] documentation to set up a project in your chosen language.
. Add the name of your Heroku application and your Heroku API key as environment variables as `HEROKU_APP_NAME` and `HEROKU_API_KEY`, respectively. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}
. Use the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[Heroku orb] to keep your config simple. The `deploy-via-git` installs the Heroku CLI in the primary container, runs any pre deployment steps you define, deploys your application, then runs any post-deployment steps you define. See the Heroku orb page in the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[orbs registry] for full details of parameters and options:
+
```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
    heroku: circleci/heroku@x.y # Use the Heroku orb in your config

workflows:
    heroku_deploy:
    jobs:
        - build
        - heroku/deploy-via-git:
            requires:
            - build # only run deploy-via-git job if the build job has completed
            filters:
            branches:
                only: main # only run deploy-via-git job on main branch
```

For more detailed information about these Heroku orbs, refer to the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku[CircleCI Heroku Orb].

== Heroku deployment with 2.0 configuration

. Create a Heroku account and follow the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/start[Getting Started on Heroku] documentation to set up a project in your chosen language.
. Add the name of your Heroku application and your Heroku API key as environment variables as `HEROKU_APP_NAME` and `HEROKU_API_KEY`, respectively. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}
. In your `.circleci/config.yml`, create a deployment job and add an <<executor-intro#,executor type>>.
. Add steps to your deployment job to checkout and deploy your code. You can specify which branch you would like to deploy, in this example we specify the main branch and deploy using a `git push` command.
+
```yaml
version: 2

jobs:
    build:
    ...
    deploy:
    docker:
        - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
            auth:
                username: mydockerhub-user
                password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
        - checkout
        - run:
            name: Deploy Main to Heroku
            command: |
            git push https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git main

workflows:
    version: 2
    build-deploy:
    jobs:
        - build
        - deploy:
            requires:
            - build # only run deploy-via-git job if the build job has completed
            filters:
            branches:
                only: main # only run deploy-via-git job on main branch
```

NOTE: Heroku provides the option "Wait for CI to pass before deploy" under deploy / automatic deploys. See the link:https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys[Heroku documentation] for details.
