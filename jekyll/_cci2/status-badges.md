[Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/basics/) > Embedding Build Status Badges

This document describes how to embed a badge that shows the build status (passed or failed) for your project in your README or in another document. You can generate code for the following formats: Image URL, Markdown, Textile, Rdoc, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and pod. 

## Overview

CircleCI provides build status badges for projects and branches. Status badges are commonly embedded in GitHub READMEs, although they can be placed virtually anywhere.

## Steps

CircleCI provides a tool to generate embed code for status badges.

1. In the _Notifications_ section of your project's settings, click _Status Badges_.
2. By default, the badge will display the status of your project's default branch. If you want to show the status of a different branch, use the Branch dropdown menu to select it.
3. (Optional) If your project is private, you will need an API token for viewing a project's details. If you haven't created a token yet, click on _API Permissions_ in the _Permissions_ section. Next, click _Create Token_, choose the _Status_ scope, and create a label for the token.
4. (Optional) If you created a token in the previous step, select the token you want to use in the _API Token_ dropdown menu.
5. Select the appropriate language from the _Embed Code_ dropdown menu.
6. Copy and paste the generated link to the web page or document where you want to display the status badge.

## Customization

If you find the standard status badge ugly, you can use the highly-attractive shield style. Behold the difference:

- Shield ![](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle.svg?style=shield&circle-token=3cc80b12ab3627373c76e13735b8bc00a1259b9e)

To use the shield style, simply replace `style=svg` with `style=shield` in the link you generated above.
