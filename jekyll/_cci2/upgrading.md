Upgrading your private CircleCI installation to 2.0 gives you the ability to use Workflows, Docker as a first-class executor, and all of the additional features and stability built into CircleCI 2.0. Work with a CircleCI Solutions Engineer to set up a 2.0 installation in your datacenter or private cloud (requires Platinum Support). Get started by [opening a support ticket](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
