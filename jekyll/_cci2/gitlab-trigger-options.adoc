GitLab **Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should start a build based on the parameters provided by GitLab's webhook.

== Introduction

CircleCI projects have pipelines and triggers.

* Pipelines define the various CI/CD 'units' of work that make up your project.
* Triggers define when and how to start a pipeline.


For GitLab triggers, CircleCI provides some common options, for example, "only build on merge requests". You can also build your own rules using the custom filter option. For example, a custom filter could allow you to only build for a specific branch or user.

== Trigger options

Configure triggers under menu:Project settings[Triggers]. You can select one of the following filters:

* **Build Push and Merge Requests**: Pipelines start when a commit is pushed to the repository, regardless of whether the branch you push to has an open merge request.
* **Only Merge Requests**: Pipelines start **only** if you push commits to a branch that has an open merge request.
* **Customize Trigger Filters**: Pipelines start when the event matches the custom filters.
