GitLab **Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should initiate a build based on the parameters provided by Gitlabâ€™s webhook. CircleCI provides some common options, for example, only build on merge requests, but you can also build your own rules using the custom filter option. For example, a custom filter would allow you to only build on a specific branch or user.
