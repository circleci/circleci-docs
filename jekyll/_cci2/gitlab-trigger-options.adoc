GitLab **Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should start a build based on the parameters provided by GitLab's webhook.

CircleCI provides some common options, for example, only build on merge requests, but you can also build your own rules using the custom filter option. For example, a custom filter would allow you to only build on a specific branch or user.

== Introduction

CircleCI projects have pipelines and triggers.

* Pipelines define the various CI/CD 'units' of work that make up your project.
* Triggers define when and how to start a pipeline.

== Trigger options

Configure triggers under menu:Project settings[Triggers]. You can select one of the following filters:

* **Build Push and Merge Requests**: pipelines start when you push commits to the repository, regardless of whether the branch you push commits to has an open merge request.
* **Only Merge Requests**: pipelines start **only** if you push commits to a branch that has an open merge request.
* **Customize Trigger Filters**: pipelines start when the event matches the custom filters.

== Custom trigger filters

Each filter follows a specific format:

1. Parameter name.
2. Logical operator.
3. Parameter value.

[TIP]

Use the btn:[Add Filter] button to configure multiple filters. +
Then specify the `and` or `or` relationship between all configured filters.
