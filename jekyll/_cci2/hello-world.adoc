:page-description: Get started with CircleCI by printing Hello World in any execution environment.
:icons: font

This page provides configuration examples to get started with a basic pipeline using any execution environment.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A code repository you want to build on CircleCI.
* Follow the xref:create-project#[Create a Project] guide to connect your repository to CircleCI. You can then use the examples below to configure a basic pipeline using any execution environment.

[#echo-hello-world-cloud]
== Echo hello world

These examples adds a job called `hello-job` that prints `hello world` to the console.

[.tab.hellocloud.Docker]
