[.serveronly]_This document is intended for system administrators of self-hosted installations of CircleCI Server._

This document outlines the containerized services that run on the Services machine within a CircleCI Server installation. This is provided both to give an overview of service operation, and to help with troubleshooting in the event of service outages. Supplementary notes and a key are provided below the following table.

=== Notes

* Database migrator services are listed here with a low failure severity as they only run at startup, however:
+
WARNING: If migrator services are down at startup connected services will fail.

* With a platinum support contract some services can be externalized (marked with * here) and managed to suit your requirements. Externalization provides higher data security and allows for redundancy to be built into your system.
