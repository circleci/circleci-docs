**Note:** We will be adding guides on troubleshooting and debugging durig the Beta phase of CircleCI 2.0.

Right now the best way to get help with 2.0 issues not answered by the documentation is to [ask on Discuss](https://discuss.circleci.com/) our community forums. It's a good idea to search there too, as beta users have already shared a lot of great information.
