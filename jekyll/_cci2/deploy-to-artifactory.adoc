In this how-to guide, you will learn how to upload artifacts to Artifactory in CircleCI.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Artifactory has documentation explaining how to use their link:https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API[REST API].

Below are some sample projects showing how to best use CircleCI and Artifactory together. Ensure that you have created your repository before starting this example, otherwise CircleCI will not have a place to store your dependencies.

[#artifactory-plugins]
== Artifactory plugins

Popular tools like Maven and Gradle have Artifactory plugins, and can deploy to Artifactory using their respective deploy commands.

[#jfrog-cli]
== JFrog CLI

If you want to use the link:https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli[JFrog CLI], you can install it by following the steps below.

[#add-jfrog-to-your-configuration]
=== 1. Add JFrog to your configuration

You can install JFrog CLI in one of a few ways. Refer to the link:https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/install#installation[JFrog documentation]. for the method best suited for your pipeline.

For example, if using Node, add the following to your `.circleci/config.yml`:

[,yml]
----
- run:
    name: Install jFrog CLI
    command: npm install -g jfrog-cli-v2-jf
----

[#configure-credentials]
=== 2. Configure credentials

Now you need to configure JFrog to use CircleCI credentials securely. CircleCI configures the client to use `$ARTIFACTORY_URL`, along with `$ARTIFACTORY_USER` and `$ARTIFACTORY_APIKEY`. These can be entered under `+Project Settings->Environment Variables+`. Configure the CLI to use these settings:

[,yml]
----
- run: ./jf config add <named_server_config> --artifactory-url $ARTIFACTORY_URL --user $ARTIFACTORY_USER --password $ARTIFACTORY_APIKEY --interactive=false
----

[#upload-jar-files]
=== 3. Upload JAR files (optional)

If you would like to upload JAR files use the following example:

[,yml]
----
command: |
            ./jf mvnc \
              --server-id-resolve <server_id> \
              --server-id-deploy <server_id> \
              --repo-resolve-releases libs-release \
              --repo-resolve-snapshots libs-snapshot \
              --repo-deploy-releases release-candidates \
              --repo-deploy-snapshots snapshots \
              --include-patterns "*.jar, *.pom, *.xml"

              /.jf mvn clean install
----

[#upload-war-files]
=== 4. Upload WAR files (optional)

If you would like to upload WAR files use the following example:

[,yml]
----
command: |
            ./jf mvnc \
              --server-id-resolve <server_id> \
              --server-id-deploy <server_id> \
              --repo-resolve-releases libs-release \
              --repo-resolve-snapshots libs-snapshot \
              --repo-deploy-releases release-candidates \
              --repo-deploy-snapshots snapshots \
              --include-patterns "*.war"

              /.jf mvn clean install
----

[#full-configuration-example]
== Full configuration example

The full `.circleci/config.yml` file would look something like the following:

{% include snippets/docker-auth.adoc %}

[,yml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  create-build-package:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/openjdk:17.0.10
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install JFrog CLI
          command: curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io/v2-jf | sh
      - run:
          name: Configure JFrog Creds
          command: |
            ./jf c add <server_id> \
              --artifactory-url $ARTIFACTORY_URL \
              --user $ARTIFACTORY_USER \
              --password $ARTIFACTORY_APIKEY \
              --interactive=false
      - run:
          name: Maven Build
          command: |
            ./jf mvnc \
              --server-id-resolve <server_id> \
              --server-id-deploy <server_id> \
              --repo-resolve-releases libs-release \
              --repo-resolve-snapshots libs-snapshot \
              --repo-deploy-releases release-candidates \
              --repo-deploy-snapshots snapshots \
              --include-patterns "*.jar, *.pom, *.xml"

            ./jf mvn clean install

workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - create-build-package:
          context: artifactory
