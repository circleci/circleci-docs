Welcome to CircleCI 2.0 Beta! The Beta release of CircleCI 2.0 includes many improvements for faster performance and greater control. If you are new to CircleCI, check out the [Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/about-circleci) for how it works and then use the [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/hello-world) doc to start your first project build.

## Programming Language Support

Code that builds on Linux will generally build on CircleCI 2.0. For some language versions, CircleCI provides demo applications with YAML file templates and instructions: 

- **Clojure 1.8 and later**, see the [Clojure Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-clojure/)
- **Elixir 1.2 and later**, see the [Elixir Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-elixir/)
- **Go 1.7 and later**, see the [Go Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-go/)
- **Java 8 and later**, see the [Java Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-java/)
- **Node.js 4 and later**, see the [JavaScript Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-javascript/)
- **PHP 5 and later**, see the [PHP Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-php/)
- **Python 2 and later**, see the [Python Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-python/)
- **Ruby 2 and later**, see the [Ruby and Rails]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-ruby/) 

Build projects in C, C#, C++, Clojure, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Haxe, Java, Javascript, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala and many more. 

## Features

CircleCi 2.0 includes infrastructure upgrades for faster performance that reduce overall time to build, test, and deploy for all platforms at scale. See the [Migration FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/faq/) for answers to common questions about the Beta.

CircleCI 2.0 gives you greater control with new configuration keys in 2.0 enable you to break up monolithic builds into separate Jobs and Steps. See [Migrating from 1.0 to 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/migrating-from-1-2/) for information about the new keys, then head over to the [2.0 Project Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/project-walkthrough/).

First-class container support is also implemented in 2.0 to give you more control over your build environment and access to native Docker features.

We’re thrilled to have you here. Happy building!
