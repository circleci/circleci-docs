Thanks for your interest in CircleCI 2.0!

We’re in the midst of sprucing up documentation for 2.0. Some sections will be empty, but not for long! We’ll be adding articles at a steady clip over the coming days.

CircleCI 2.0 is a powerful tool but, as always, with great power comes great responsibility. While in Beta, you should be comfortable writing YAML, writing shell commands, and have some familiarity with Docker.

## I’m Lost, Where Do I Go?

If you’re completely new to CircleCI, then go read about [what we do][about-circleci] and follow up with your [first steps][first-steps].

If you’re familiar with CircleCI, you should check out the major changes in 2.0 and learn how to [migrate from 1.0][migrating-to-1-2].

Do you just want to see working configuration for a [sample project][project-walkthrough]? Or maybe you have a [specific language or framework][languages-and-tools] in mind?

Wherever you start, we’re thrilled to have you here. Happy building!
