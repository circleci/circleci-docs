Welcome to CircleCI 2.0! CircleCI 2.0 includes many improvements for faster performance and greater control. If you are new to CircleCI, check out the [Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/about-circleci) for how it works and then use the [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/hello-world) doc to start your first project build.

## Programming Language Support

Code that builds on Linux will generally build on CircleCI 2.0. For some language versions, CircleCI provides demo applications with YAML file templates and instructions: 

- **Clojure 1.2.0 and later**, see the [Clojure Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-clojure/)
- **Elixir 1.2 and later**, see the [Elixir Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-elixir/)
- **Go 1.7 and later**, see the [Go Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-go/)
- **Java 8 and later**, see the [Java Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-java/)
- **Node.js 4 and later**, see the [JavaScript Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-javascript/)
- **PHP 5 and later**, see the [PHP Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-php/)
- **Python 2 and later**, see the [Python Language Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-python/)
- **Ruby 2 and later**, see the [Ruby and Rails Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/language-ruby/) 

Build projects in C, C#, C++, Clojure, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Haxe, Java, Javascript, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala and many more. 

## Features

CircleCI 2.0 includes infrastructure upgrades for faster performance that reduce overall time to build, test, and deploy for all platforms at scale. See the [Migration FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/faq/) for answers to common questions.

CircleCI 2.0 gives you greater control with new configuration keys in 2.0 enable you to break up monolithic builds into separate Jobs and Steps. See [Migrating from 1.0 to 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/migrating-from-1-2/) for information about the new keys, then head over to the [2.0 Project Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/project-walkthrough/).

First-class container support is also implemented in 2.0 to give you more control over your build environment and access to native Docker features.

Weâ€™re thrilled to have you here. Happy building!
