This page describes how to migrate an existing launch agent installation to machine runner 3.0. Machine runner 3.0 includes improved network resiliency, and a simpler installation management strategy, utilizing operating system packages.

Migrating from launch agent to machine runner 3.0 is a straightforward process. The prerequisites remain the same. First, uninstall and remove launch agent, then, install the machine runner 3.0 agent. The configuration file is 1:1 compatible between the agents so no modifications are needed during the migration
