GitHub has two different SSH keys&mdash;a _deploy_ key and a _user_ key.
When you add a GitHub repository to CircleCI, we automatically add a deploy
key that references this repository.
For most customers, this is all CircleCI needs to run their tests.

Each deploy key is valid for only _one_ repository.
In contrast, a GitHub user key has access to _all_ of your GitHub repositories.

If your testing process refers to multiple repositories
(for example, if you have a Gemfile that points at a  private `git` repository),
CircleCI will be unable to check out such repositories with only a deploy key.
When testing requires access to different repositories, CircleCI will need a GitHub user key.

You can provide CircleCI with a GitHub user key on your project's
**Project Settings > Checkout SSH keys** page.
CircleCI creates and associates this new SSH key with your GitHub user account
and then has access to all your repositories.

CircleCI is serious when it comes to security.
We will never make your SSH keys public.

Remember that SSH keys should be shared only with trusted users.
Anyone that is a GitHub collaborator on a project employing user keys
can access your repositories as you.
Beware of someone stealing your code.

<h2 id="machine-user-keys">Machine user keys</h2>

A [machine user](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) is a GitHub user which you create only for automated tasks. Machine user accounts are not intended to be used by a human.

You can add a machine user's SSH key to your projects on CircleCI and use that key as the *Checkout SSH key* for these projects, instead of using deploy keys or your own SSH keys.

The main benefit of using a machine user's SSH key instead of a regular user's key is that you can lock down the machine user's access to just the repos that it _needs_ to access.

Here are the steps to set a machine user's SSH key as a checkout key for your project.  We recommend doing this in an incognito window, as you will have to sign out of your normal user's Github and CircleCI accounts.

- First, you need to login to GitHub as the machine user.

- Go to <https://circleci.com> and log in. GitHub will ask you to authorize CircleCI to access the machine user's account, so click on the **Authorize application** button.

- Click on "Projects" on the left and follow the projects you want the machine user to have access to.

- Once followed, go to the **Project Settings > Checkout SSH keys** page and then click on the ***Authorize w/GitHub*** button. That gives us permission to create and upload SSH keys to GitHub on behalf of the machine user.

- Finally, click the ***Create and add XXXX user key*** button on the same page.

That's it. Now CircleCI will use the machine user's SSH key for any git commands run during your builds.

<h2 id="error-messages">User key access-related error messages</h2>

Here are common errors that indicate you need to add a user key.

**Python**: During the `pip install` step:

```
ERROR: Repository not found.
```

**Ruby**: During the `bundle install` step:

```
Permission denied (publickey).
```
