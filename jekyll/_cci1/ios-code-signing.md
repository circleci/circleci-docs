## Quick start guide

To get code signing working for your iOS app using our automated code
signing support, you would need to do the following:

1. Upload your provisioning profile (`.mobileprovision`) and private key (`.p12`)
   files in **Project Settings > iOS Code Signing**.
1. Set `GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` to match your code-signing identity, i.e.
`iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc.`.
1. Build with [gym](https://fastlane.tools/gym) and deploy with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/fastlane).

## Background: Code Signing Process

The code-signing process for iOS apps can seem difficult at first, but
once familiar with the concepts the process is less daunting.

There are 2 necessary items for signing an app:

* A provisioning profile (`.mobileprovision`)
* A corresponding developer private-key (`.p12`).

With these 2 files, and an Xcode project the goal is to produce 2 files:

* A signed application (`.ipa`)
* A debug symbols archive (`.app.dSYM.zip`).

The `.ipa` file is the application file that can be distributed to your
testers using a service such as
[Crashlytics Beta](http://try.crashlytics.com/beta/)
or [Hockey App](http://hockeyapp.net).
The debug symbols file will be used by your distribution service of choice
to produce call-stacks helping you to debug any crashes in your app that
testers encounter.

### macOS circle Keychain
When signing an app, Xcode will look in any
[keychains](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html)
on the machine to find the necessary code-signing credentials. CircleCI
creates a keychain containing any code-signing credentials that you have
uploaded in Project Settings automatically, so you should not have to
interact with the keychain in most circumstances.

The keychain that CircleCI creates is named `circle.keychain`, and the
password is `circle`. This keychain is unlocked for the duration of the
build, and it is added to the default search path. Any P12 certificates
or provisioning profiles that you have uploaded are added to this keychain
before your build begins. Any futher credentials that you add to this
keychain will be available to Xcode.

### 1. Install Fastlane tools locally
This guide assumes that you are developing on a Mac running macOS. The
first step is to install the Fastlane tools. If you are using the
system Ruby, you can install using

```
sudo gem install fastlane
```

Or if you are using a Ruby installed using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
you can install as the current user:

```
gem install fastlane
```

The tools take a few minutes to install, so a little patience is
required. For more information check out the [Fastlane installation
documentation](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/#installation)

### 2. Create and Upload a Code Signing Certificate

To create a code signing certificate and keys we will use the `cert`
Fastlane tool. Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run the
following commands:

    $ mkdir certificates
    $ fastlane cert --output_path certificates

This will create 3 files in the `certificates` directly, all named after
the certificate. In my case the certificate is named `NK5Z971JCM` but
this will be different for each project.

    $ ls certificates

    NK5Z971JCM.cer
    NK5Z971JCM.certSigningRequest
    NK5Z971JCM.p12

The `.certSigningRequest` and `.cer` files are not needed to sign your
app using CircleCI. You can delete these files if you have no need for
them. The `.p12` file is the private key for your code-signing identity.

Now use the `sigh` tool to create a new provisioning profile.

    $ fastlane sigh --output_path certificates

This will create a provisioning profile (a file with the `.mobileprovision`
extension) in the `certificates` directory.

You can now upload the `.p12` and `.mobileprovision` files to your project on CircleCI in
`Project Settings` > `iOS Code Signing`.

### 3. Find Your Code Signing Identity name

One your local machine run the following command to list the current
code-signing identities installed on your machine.

    $ security find-identity -p codesigning

You should see output like the following:

```
Policy: Code Signing
  Matching identities
  1) 0620A954DE3B589E378435B38B8D87B6C0436BB0 "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"
     1 identities found

  Valid identities only
  1) 0620A954DE3B589E378435B38B8D87B6C0436BB0 "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"
     1 valid identities found
```

The string with the form `"iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"`
is your code-signing identity. You might have more than one identity on
your local machine, so choose the correct one for your app. You should
add this to your `circle.yml` file as follows, so that it's available
during the build:

```
machine:
  environment:
    GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY: "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"
```

### 4. Sign Your App on CircleCI

We recommend using [Fastlane Gym](https://github.com/fastlane/gym) to
build a signed app. `gym` is pre-installed on our containers, so it's
easy to set up. The first step is to add a new [deployment
command]( {{ site.baseurl }}/1.0/configuration/#deployment) in your
`circle.yml` file.

```
machine:
  environment:
    GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY: "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"

deployment:
  beta_distribution:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - fastlane gym
```

You should take a few minutes to read [the documentation on deployments
using CircleCI]( {{ site.baseurl }}/1.0/configuration/#deployment).
The deployment stanza above instructs CircleCI to run the `fastlane gym`
command on each successful build of the `master` branch. The `beta_distribution`
is just a name for the deployment. You can use any name here.

You might need to pass additional parameters to `fastlane gym` to specify
exactly which configuration to build, but in most cases these are not
necessary. If you are having problems building a signed app, you can run
the `fastlane gym` command locally specifying `GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY ` or
`--codesigning_identity` (and any other options that are necessary) until you
manage to generate a signed app locally. You can then edit the command in your
`circle.yml` file as necessary.

```
deployment:
  beta_distribution:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - gym --scheme "App" --workspace "App.xcworkspace"
```

### 5. Distribute the `.ipa` file to your beta testers

Using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/fastlane) you can easily distribute the
binary to your beta testers right after generating it. If you don't have
`fastlane` set up for your project yet, run `fastlane init`.

All you have to add to your `Fastfile`:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  sigh
  gym

  # You can use any beta testing service below:
  pilot # (TestFlight)
  crashlytics
  hockey
  s3
  deploygate
  ...
end
```

`fastlane` will automatically pass on information about the `.ipa` file from
`gym` to the beta testing service of your choice, so you don't have to manually
provide a path to the `.ipa` and `.dsym` file.

## Troubleshooting

In this section we show a few of the most common errors that can be seen
with the code signing, and offer ways to work around these issues.

### No valid signing identities

If you get an error like

    Code Sign error: No code signing identities found: No valid signing
identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) matching the team ID
“3EF4ATW3JB” were found.
or

    Code Sign error: No code signing identities found: No valid signing
identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) were found.

Then Xcode was not able to find the correct keychain to use. The first
step to take is to example the output of the "Install Code Signing
Credentials" step of the build on CircleCI. This is listed under
"machine". Expand the output and you should see output like the
following:

![The output of the code signing step that ran correctly](  {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/code-signing-correct-step-output.png)

In this example there is one valid code-signing identity, `"iPhone
Distribution: UTAH STREET LABS INC (GL92ZZ6423)"`. The goal is to pass
this literal string to Xcode. If you are building with Fastlane and
`gym`, then you should ensure that you have your code-signing identity
string in your `circle.yml` like this:

```
machine:
  environment:
    GYM_CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY: "iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc. (GL31ZZ3256)"
```

Or that you pass this string to `gym` with the `--codesigning_identity`
flag.

If you are calling `xcodebuild` directly you should pass your
code-signing identity as the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=` parameter, for
example `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="iPhone Distribution: Acme Inc.
(GL31ZZ3256)"`.


### No provisioning profiles matching an applicable signing identity were found

If you get an error message that says:

    Code Sign error: No matching provisioning profiles found: No
    provisioning profiles matching an applicable signing identity were
    found.

This means that you have a valid P12 file, but there was no matching
provisioning profile found. The first thing to check is that you have a
valid provisioning profile file (`.mobileprovision`) checked in to your
repository. Then take a look at the output from the "Install Code
Signing Credentials" step of the build. It should no longer be saying
`"No provisioning profiles found in repository."` The output shout give
a list of the provisioning profiles that were found as follows:

    Installed provisioning profile 616323a4-5216-42b0-b150-a128674ec52f
    (UTAH STREET LABS INC - CircleCI iOS Game - ["GL92ZZ6423"])
    1 certificate imported.


### My build fails with a timeout during code-signing

If your build fails with a timeout during the code-signing process, the
issue is usually that the correct keychains are not unlocked, or the
keychains are not added to the system search path. The first thing to
check is the output of `security list-keychains`. You should add a step
to your build to run `security list-keychains` immediately before the
command that times out.

You should see the following:

    $ security list-keychains
        "/Users/distiller/Library/Keychains/login.keychain"
        "/Users/distiller/Library/Keychains/circle.keychain"
        "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain"

You need to ensure that `login.keychain` and `circle.keychain` are in
this list. If you are adding a custom keychain using your own commands,
make sure that you are unlocking the keychain too. Make sure you are
doing something like the following:

    security unlock-keychain       -p circle circle.keychain
    security set-keychain-settings -lut 7200 circle.keychain


### What Does "Install Code Signing Credentials" Do?

The "Install Code Signing Credentials" step of macOS builds is where we
prepare the container for code-signing before your builds runs.

1. We create a new keychain called `circle.keychain` with password
   `circle`. We unlock this keychain and add it to the system search
path so Xcode can access it.
1. We install any P12 certificates that you have uploaded in project
   settings to circle.keychain
1. We look through your repo and find any provisioning profiles you
   have. We copy any profiles to `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning
Profiles`, and we add any certificates in the provisioning profiles to
circle.keychain (the public key in the provisioning profile should match
the private key in the P12 file).
1. We call `security find-identity -p codesigning` to list the keychains
   in the build output.
