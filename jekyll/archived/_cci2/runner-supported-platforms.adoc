// == Available CircleCI's self-hosted runner platforms

// CircleCI's self-hosted runners are available on multiple platforms. Support levels fall into two categories:

// * <<Supported>>
// * <<Preview>>

// [#supported]
// === Supported

// *Supported* Level platforms ensure that CircleCI's self-hosted runners are both built and tested on their respective systems.

// With a *Supported* platform, users receive the following:

// * Documentation and best practices
// * Support: CircleCI customer engineers will assist customers to resolve issues within their usual Advanced Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

// *Supported* CircleCI's self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

// * Ubuntu 18.04 or later (x86_64 or ARM64)
// * RHEL8 (x86_64 or ARM64)
// * Mac OS X 10.15+ (Intel)
// * macOS 11.2+ (Apple M1)
// * Docker (x86_64 or ARM64)
// * Kubernetes (x86_64)
// * Windows Server 2019, 2016 (x86_64)

// [#preview]
// === Preview

// On *Preview* Level platforms, CircleCI's self-hosted runners are currently in development, thus testing is not complete.

// With a *Preview* platform, users receive the following:

// * A full integration that is a work-in-progress -- thus, some manual configuration may be required to install, configure, and deploy
// * Work-in-progress documentation and best practices
// * Support: CircleCI Customer Engineers will provide assistance and guidance on best practices for installing, configuring, and operating CircleCI's self-hosted runners
// ** Users are encouraged to provide feedback in order to rapidly improve the CircleCI's self-hosted runner user experience and meet its necessary criteria as a *Supported* platform

// *Preview* CircleCI's self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

// * Additional Linux distributions - RHEL, SUSE, Debian, etc. (x86_64 or ARM64)
// * Kubernetes (ARM64)
