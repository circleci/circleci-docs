term: Environment Variables
---

Environment variables store customer data that is used by a project. Only project administrators and owners are allowed to view or modify environment variables. The values are transmitted using secure protocols, for example, HTTPS and SSH, encrypted at rest, and hashed/salted to prevent CircleCI employees from viewing them.
