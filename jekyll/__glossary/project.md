A CircleCI project shares the name of the code repository for which it automates workflows, tests, and deployment. It is visible on the **Projects** page of the [CircleCI web app](https://app.circleci.com/) and must be added with the **Set Up Project** button. After a project is added, it is possible to configure settings, contexts, environment variables, and team members who may follow the project. Following a project enables you to subscribe to email notifications for the project's build status, and adds the project to your CircleCI dashboard.
