Authentication of CircleCI projects using the hosted application is handled by GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google OAuth. Sessions last for 14 days. See the [Permissions Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#permissions-overview) and [Permissions for Team Accounts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#permissions-for-team-accounts) sections of the GitHub and Bitbucket Integrations document for additional details.

User authentication may use LDAP for an instance of the CircleCI application that is installed on your private server or cloud, see the [Authentication]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/authentication/) document for setup instructions.
