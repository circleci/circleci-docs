term: Context

Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. The environment variables are defined as name/value pairs and are injected at runtime. Environment variables are set on the Contexts page. To use these variables in a workflow, users must be members of the context's organization. The rule must allow access to all projects in the org. See the [Contexts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/contexts/) document for instructions.
