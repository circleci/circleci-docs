:page-description: Get started with CircleCI by printing Hello World in any execution environment.
:icons: font

This page shows you how to get started with a basic pipeline using any execution environment. The steps described here assume you want to create a new project locally and push your changes to your VCS using Git. This page also assumes you have already link:/docs/first-steps/[signed up] for CircleCI.

As an alternative, if you already have a repository you want to "plug in" to CircleCI you can set this up entirely within the CircleCI web app, including commiting a config file. This flow is outlined in the link:/docs/getting-started[Quickstart guide].

[#echo-hello-world-cloud]
== Echo hello world

This example adds a job called `hello-job` that simply prints `hello world` to the console. まずは以下の手順を行います。

. Create a directory called `.circleci` in the root directory of your local code repository.
. From the `.circleci` directory you just created, create a link:/docs/configuration-reference[`config.yml`] file and add the following content (select your execution environment using the tabs):
+
[.tab.hellocloud.Docker]
--
The job `hello-job` spins up a container running a link:/docs/circleci-images/#nodejs[pre-built CircleCI Docker image for Node]. Refer to link:/docs/using-docker[Using the Docker execution environment] page for more information.

. Commit and push the changes to your VCS.
. Go to the **Projects** page in the CircleCI web app, then click the **Set Up Project** button next to your new project. If you do not see your project, make sure you have selected the correct organization at the top-left of the web app. See the link:/docs/introduction-to-the-circleci-web-app#organization-switching[Organization Switching] for more information.
. Follow the steps in the pop-up to tell CircleCI to use the `config.yml` file you just created to trigger your first pipeline. Clicking through to the `hello-job` and then selecting the `echo "hello world" step` will show you `hello world` in the console.
