NOTE: 現在、よりスケーラブルでコンテナフレンドリーなセルフホストランナー、<container-runner#,コンテナランナー> の **オープンプレビュー** を行っています。 詳細については、 link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/a-more-scalable-container-friendly-self-hosted-runner-container-agent-now-in-open-preview/45094[Discuss の投稿 (英語)] をご覧ください。

[#introduction]
== はじめに

CircleCI's self-hosted runner enables you to use your own infrastructure for running jobs. これにより、より幅広いアーキテクチャでビルドとテストができるようになり、環境をより細かく制御することもできるようになります。

You have the option of installing your self-hosted runner in a Kubernetes cluster using a container runner, or within a machine execution environment using a machine runner. The diagrams below illustrate how CircleCI's container runner and machine runner extend our existing systems.

[#circleci-runner-use-cases]
== CircleCI ランナーのユースケース

There are two key use cases CircleCI aims to meet with self-hosted runners:

* Privileged access and controls - CircleCI understands that some customers require running jobs on on-premises or limited-access infrastructure due to stricter isolation requirements. ランナーを使用することで、次のようなことが可能になります。
** IP restrictions - Self-hosted runners can have static IP addresses that you can control
** Identity Access Management (IAM) permissions - If you set up self-hosted runners in AWS, they can be assigned IAM permissions
** オペレーティングシステムの監視
** プライベートネットワークへの接続
* Unique compute requirements - Customers who need to run jobs on an environment or architecture that CircleCI does not offer as a resource class can use the self-hosted runner to fill that need.

[#choosing-a-runner-execution-environment]
== Choosing a runner execution environment

CircleCI offers multiple execution environments for self-hosted runners: container and machine.

[#container-runner-use-case]
=== Container runner

Container runner is installed in a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster which enables you to run containerized jobs on self-hosted compute, similar to how jobs use the native Docker executor to run on CircleCI’s cloud platform. This solution allows you to run hundreds of jobs at once, scaling pods effectively to meet compute demands.

Container runner allows you to use CircleCI's <<circleci-images#,convenience images>> as well as custom Docker images.

[#machine-runner-use-case]
=== Machine runner

Machine runner is installed either in a virtual machine, or natively on a physical machine. Each machine runner job executes in the same environment (virtual or physical) where the self-hosted runner binary is installed. CircleCI's machine runner can be installed on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Machine runner should be used if you are not running containerized CI jobs, see <<docker-to-machine,machine execution environment>> docs for more examples on when to use a machine execution environment.

If you do not use Kubernetes but still want to run your CI job in a container on a self-hosted runner, you can install the machine runner in Docker.

Machine runner is not compatible with CircleCI's convienience images or custom Docker images.

[#getting-started]
== 作業を開始する

To get started with CircleCI's self-hosted runners:

* Provide your own platform to deploy your CircleCI's self-hosted runners (see the <<#available-self-hosted-runner-platforms,Available self-hosted runner platforms>> section for supported platforms)
* For container runner installation, visit the <<container-runner#, Container runner>> page.
* For machine runner, installation vistit the xref:runner-installation.adoc[Web app installation] page.

[#circleci-self-hosted-runner-operation]
== CircleCI's self-hosted runner operation

Once a CircleCI's self-hosted runner is installed, the self-hosted runner polls `circleci.com` for work, runs jobs, and returns status, logs, and artifacts to CircleCI.

[#available-self-hosted-runner-platforms]
== Available self-hosted runner platforms

*Supported* level platforms ensure that CircleCI's self-hosted runners are both built and tested on their respective systems.

With a supported platform, users receive the following:

* ドキュメントとベストプラクティス
* サポート: CircleCI カスタマー エンジニアによる、Advanced サービスレベルアグリーメント (SLA) の範囲内の問題解決支援

*Supported* CircleCI's self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

**Container and machine self-hosted runners:**

* Ubuntu 18.04 or later (x86_64, ARM64)

**Container runners:**

* Kubernetes (x86_64, ARM64)

**Machine runners:**

* macOS X 11.2+ (Intel, Apple M1)
* Windows Server 2019, 2016 (x86_64)
* Linux distributions - RHEL8, SUSE, Debian, etc (x86_64, ARM64)

CircleCI sometimes offers a **preview** level platform when a new platform for self-hosted runner is in active development. If there is a platform in a preview level, this section will be updated with information and limitations for that platform.

[#limitations]
== 制限事項

標準的な CircleCI 機能のほとんどすべてがセルフホストランナージョブで使用できますが、現時点では、まだいくつかサポートされていない機能があります。

* The following built-in environment variables are not populated within runner executors:
** `CIRCLE_PREVIOUS_BUILD_NUM`
** すべての非推奨クラウド環境変数
* Docker レイヤーキャッシュ
* For limitations relating to container runner, visit the <<container-runner#limitations, Container runner>> page.
