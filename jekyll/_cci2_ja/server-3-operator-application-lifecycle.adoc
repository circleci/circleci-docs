CircleCI is committed to supporting four minor versions of the software. This means a minor version will receive patches
for up to 12 months. In order to help identify releases and their impact to your installation, we use semantic versioning.

## Semantic Versioning
Given a version number, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH increment, the:

. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Release Schedule
We release monthly patch fixes for bugs and security concerns. We will have quarterly new feature releases. All releases
will be posted to the change log. To stay up to date with the most recent releases, please subscribe to the
https://circleci.com/server/changelog/[change log].
