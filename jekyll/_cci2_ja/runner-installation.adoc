== Prerequisites

The installation process assumes you have installed the following utilities on your system:

* <<local-cli#installation,CircleCI CLI>>
* curl (installed by default on macOS)
* sha256sum (installed as part of coreutils on Linux apt/yum, macOS via brew)
* systemd version 235+ (Linux only)
* sepolicy (RHEL 8 only)
* rpmbuild (RHEL 8 only)
* permissions to create a user, and create directories under /opt.

Running jobs requires you have the following tools available on your machine:

* tar
* gzip
* coreutils (Linux only)
* git (recommended, but not required)

== Authentication

NOTE: These commands can only be run by an owner/admin of your organization.

In order to complete this process you will need to create a namespace and authentication token by performing the steps listed below:

. Create a namespace for your organization's runner resources.
+
NOTE: Each organization can only create a single namespace. If you already use orbs, this namespace will be the same namespace as the orbs use. 
+ 
Use the following command: 
+
```
circleci namespace create <name> <vcs-type> <org-name>
```
+
For example, if your GitHub URL is `\https://github.com/circleci`, then use: `circleci namespace create my-namespace github circleci`.
. Create a resource class for your runner for your namespace using the following command:
+ 
NOTE: Your newly created namespace is required in the command to create your resource class.
+
```
circleci runner resource-class create <name>/<resource-class> <description> --generate-token
``` 
+
Example: `circleci runner resource-class create my-namespace/my-resource-class my-description --generate-token`.
+
NOTE: To create resource classes and tokens you need to be an organization administrator in the VCS provider.
+
CAUTION: The default token cannot be retrieved again, so be sure to store it safely.

== Installation

=== Download the launch agent binary and verify the checksum
[[download]]
The launch agent can be installed using the following script, which will use `opt/circleci` as the base install location.

First, set one of these variables as appropriate for for your installation target.

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Installation Target
| Variable

| For Linux x86_64
| `platform=linux/amd64`

| For Linux ARM64
| `platform=linux/arm64`

| For macOS x86_64
| `platform=darwin/amd64`

| For macOS M1
| `platform=darwin/arm64`
|===

Next, set the `circleci-launch-agent` version. Runners on cloud auto-update to the latest supported versions. For server, specific runner versions are validated for interoperability and runners do not auto-update. A table of server `circleci-launch-agent` versions can be found <<runner-for-server-compatibility,here>>.

For cloud, you can run the following:
```bash
export base_url="https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-launch-agent"
export agent_version=$(curl "${base_url}/release.txt")
```

For server v3.1.0 and up, run the following, substituting `<launch-agent-version>` with the correct launch agent version for the version of server you are running (see <<runner-for-server-compatibility>> to find the correct version):
```bash
export agent_version="<launch-agent-version>"
```

Finally, run the following script to download, verify and install the binary.
```bash
# Set up runner directory
prefix=/opt/circleci
sudo mkdir -p "$prefix/workdir"

# Downloading launch agent
echo "Using CircleCI Launch Agent version $agent_version"
echo "Downloading and verifying CircleCI Launch Agent Binary"
base_url="https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-launch-agent"
curl -sSL "$base_url/$agent_version/checksums.txt" -o checksums.txt
file="$(grep -F "$platform" checksums.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed 's/^.//')"
mkdir -p "$platform"
echo "Downloading CircleCI Launch Agent: $file"
curl --compressed -L "$base_url/$agent_version/$file" -o "$file"

# Verifying download
echo "Verifying CircleCI Launch Agent download"
grep "$file" checksums.txt | sha256sum --check && chmod +x "$file"; sudo cp "$file" "$prefix/circleci-launch-agent" || echo "Invalid checksum for CircleCI Launch Agent, please try download again"
```

=== Platform-specific instructions

Please refer to the platform-specific installation instructions:

== Runner for Server Compatibility
_CircleCI Runner is available from server v3.1.0_

Each minor version of server is compatible with a specific version of
`circleci-launch-agent`. The table below lists which version of `circleci-launch-agent` to use when installing runner,
depending on your version of server:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Server version  
| Launch Agent Version

| 3.0             
| Runner not supported

| 3.1            
| 1.0.11147-881b608

| 3.2
