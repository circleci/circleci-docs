To update your CircleCI Server installation, see our https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/updating-server/#section=server-administration[Upgrade Guide]. This guide only runs through the steps required to update Replicated, not the CircleCI application.

== Prerequisites

* Your installation is Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 based.
* Your installation is **not** airgapped and you can access the internet from it.
* We will be updating to Replicated v2.38, but first we need to check you are running at least v2.10.3 on your Services machine. To check this, SSH into the Services machine and run the following:
+
```shell
replicated --version
```
+
If you are running a version of Replicated pre 2.10.3 please reach out to support@circleci.com.

== Preparations

CAUTION: Remember to take a snapshot (described https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/updating-server/#section=server-administration[here]) before starting the Replicated update process

. Stop the CircleCI application by clicking the Stop Now button on the Dashboard. Application shutdown takes a few minutes. Wait for the status to become “Stopped” before continuing.
+
.Stop the CircleCI Application

+
Alternatively you can SSH into the services machine and stop the CircleCI application from the command line:
+
```shell
replicatedctl app stop
```
+
You can check the status using the followng:
+
```shell
replicatedctl app status inspect
```
+
Example Output:
+
```shell
[
    {
        "AppID": "edd9471be0bc4ea04dfca94718ddf621",
        "Sequence": 2439,
        "State": "stopped",
        "DesiredState": "stopped",
        "Error": "",
        "IsCancellable": false,
        "IsTransitioning": false,
        "LastModifiedAt": "2018-10-23T22:00:21.314987894Z"
    }
]
```

. For the replicated update to succeed, it is necessary to update docker to the recommended version, 17.12.1. Check which version you are running with `docker version` and if you need to update, follow these steps:
// should there be a step to check Docker version first?
+
```shell
sudo apt-get install docker-ce=17.12.1~ce-0~ubuntu
```

. Pin the Docker version using the following command:
+
```shell
sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce
```

== Perform Update

. Perform the Replicated update by executing the update script as follows:
+
```shell
curl -sSL "https://get.replicated.com/docker?replicated_tag=2.38.6" | sudo bash
```
+
Double-check your replicated and docker versions:
+
```shell
replicatedctl version    # 2.38.6
docker -v                # 17.12.1
```

. Restart the app with
+
```shell
replicatedctl app start
```
+
The application will take a few minutes to spin up. You can check the progress in the administration dashboard or by executing;
+
```shell
replicatedctl app status inspect
```
+
Example output:
+
```shell
[
    {
        "AppID": "edd9471be0bc4ea04dfca94718ddf621",
        "Sequence": 2439,
        "State": "started",
        "DesiredState": "started",
        "Error": "",
        "IsCancellable": true,
        "IsTransitioning": true,
        "LastModifiedAt": "2018-10-23T22:04:05.00374451Z"
    }
]
```
