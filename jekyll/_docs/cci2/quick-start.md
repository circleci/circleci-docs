This is a test document.

This guide is for developers using existing installations of CircleCI Enterprise.
Instructions for installing and setting up Enterprise can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/overview/).
For developers testing and deploying their code with CircleCI Enterprise, the
experience extremely similar to using circleci.com, so much of the information in the
[docs](https://circleci.com/docs/) and [support forum](https://discuss.circleci.com)
for circleci.com are applicable. There are a few potentially
confusing differences between CircleCI Enterpise and circleci.com though, so this guide
provides a starting point specifically for users of Enterprise.

Let's quickly cover a few of the first things you might want to try on CircleCI Enterprise. If you
are curious about the differences between your CircleCI Enterprise installation and public circleci.com,
you can skip to the [differences from circleci.com]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/differences/).
