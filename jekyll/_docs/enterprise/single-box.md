---

CircleCI Enterprise is a scalable CI/CD tool that supports clusters
of tens or hundreds of build machines. However, it is often useful
in trials and small installations to run the whole system on a single
VM. See the instructions for your installation environment below.

## Prerequisites

The single-box installation is designed to be as easy as possible to install in
any environment. There are just a few firm requirements:

- You must use **GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise**
  for version control, and the CircleCI Enterprise machine and the GitHub machines
  must be able to reach each other on the network.
- The machine running CircleCI Enterprise must have outbound internet access.

## On AWS

Installing CircleCI Enterpise on a single EC2 VM is extremely quick and
easy with our pre-made AMI.


<ol>
<li>Find the AMI for your region (make sure to use an instance type with at least 8G of RAM):<br>

  <script>
  var amiIds = {
  "ap-northeast-1": "ami-bd4133da",
  "ap-northeast-2": "ami-1b70a675",
  "ap-southeast-1": "ami-f808a09b",
  "ap-southeast-2": "ami-d1f7f2b2",
  "eu-central-1": "ami-6713de08",
  "eu-west-1": "ami-d70e26a4",
  "sa-east-1": "ami-8c9802e0",
  "us-east-1": "ami-b6b455a0",
  "us-east-2": "ami-c86144ad",
  "us-west-1": "ami-3c194a5c",
  "us-west-2": "ami-13df6d73"
  };

  var amiUpdateSelect = function() {
    var s = document.getElementById("ami-select");
    var region = s.options[s.selectedIndex].value;
    document.getElementById("ami-go").href = "https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=" + region + "#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=" + amiIds[region];
  };
  </script>

  <select id="ami-select" onchange="amiUpdateSelect()">
  <option value="ap-northeast-1">ap-northeast-1</option>
  <option value="ap-northeast-2">ap-northeast-2</option>
  <option value="ap-southeast-1">ap-southeast-1</option>
  <option value="ap-southeast-2">ap-southeast-2</option>
  <option value="eu-central-1">eu-central-1</option>
  <option value="eu-west-1">eu-west-1</option>
  <option value="sa-east-1">sa-east-1</option>
  <option value="us-east-1" selected="selected">us-east-1</option>
  <option value="us-east-2">us-east-2</option>
  <option value="us-west-1">us-west-1</option>
  <option value="us-west-2">us-west-2</option>
  </select>
  <a id="ami-go" href="" class="btn btn-success" target="_blank">Go!</a>

<script>amiUpdateSelect();</script>
</li>

<li>Make sure that ports 22,80,443, and 8800 are open when you get to the "Configure Security Group" step.
You will also need to open ports 64535-65535 to let developers optionally SSH into builds.</li>

<li>Go to the public (or private) IP address or hostname for the VM once launched and complete the rest of the guided install process.
(Note: Final startup of the app can take some time as the "circleci/build-image" Docker image is downloaded.)</li>
</ol>

## On Other Platforms

It is also possible to install a trial of CircleCI Enterprise on a single VM on other cloud providers,
like GCE or Azure, as well as private datacenters using VMware or OpenStack.

1. Launch a VM with at least 8GB of RAM, 100GB of disk space on the root volume, and a version of Linux that supports Docker. Ports 22 and 8800
should be open to administrators, ports 80 and 443 should be open to all users, and ports 64535-65535 need to be open for developers to optionally SSH into builds.

2. Install Replicated, the tool used to package and distribute CircleCI Enterprise: `curl https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash`. (Note: Make sure Docker is not using the device mapper storage driver. You can check this by running `sudo docker info | grep "Storage Driver"`.)

3. Visit port 8800 on the machine in a web browser and complete the guided install process.
