* Write headings in a logical sequence. If you read out section titles in order, this should present a good storyline for the doc.

* Do not skip heading levels â€“ try not to jump from, for example, `h2` to `h4`.

* Try not to have a heading with no paragraph text to accompany it. Add at least an overview or intro to what comes next.

* All headings are in sentence case. This means only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.

* Jekyll automatically creates an h1 heading from the doc title, so only use h2 and greater in the body of the doc.

* Where possible, headings should begin with a verb.

* When referencing headings in prose, use the full heading with no quotes, and use title case.
