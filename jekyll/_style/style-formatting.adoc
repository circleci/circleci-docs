== Styling text

* Use **bold** for GUI menu options and button text. For example:
** Select **Organization Settings** from the sidebar
** Select **VCS** in the **Project Settings** window
** Select **Projects** from the sidebar and click **Set Up Project** for the project you want to follow
* Use italics for technical terms and to refer to a specific guide within docs, for example:
** TBC
