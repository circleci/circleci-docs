* If youâ€™re adding a screenshot, make it look nicer by sticking it in here: https://browserframe.com/. Choose **Generic Light** and drag and drop your screenshot into the window, then download and you will get a PNG.

* When creating screenshots use a browser extension or similar to resize the window to 1440x900. 

* If taking a screenshot of the CircleCI app include the sidebar menu so the reader can see what page you are on.

* Think about how clear the location of your screenshot is for unfamiliar users. It is best to include the full width of the screen, if possible, so the location of what you are drawing attention to is clear. An image of a button with no wider reference can be confusing.
