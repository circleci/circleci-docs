Ensure authentication with GitHub/Bitbucket
A single command can be used to test that your

keys are set up as expected. 
For GitHub run:

ssh git@github.com
or f


or Bitbucket run:

ssh -Tv git@bitbucket.org
and you should see:

$ Hi :username! You've successfully authenticated...
for GitHub or for Bitbucket:

$ logged in as :username.
If you donâ€™t see output like that, 
you need to start by troubleshooting your SSH keys with GitHub
/ troubleshooting your SSH keys with Bitbucket
