= CircleCI Server Documentation

Server documentation is written in ASCIIDOC and built for the web and PDF using ASCIIDOCTOR + Jekyll and PDF plugins.

== Document Structure
Server documentation is provided in two formats - html on the main CircleCI docs site generated with Jekyll, showing the current docs, and also PDFs of our Operations and Installation guides are provided for each feature release.

Each topic is written in a separate `.adoc` file, and for the purposes of PDF generation there are maste `.adoc` files for the ops guide (`ops-guide.adoc`) and the installation guide (`install-aws.adoc`) that combine the separate topics using: `include::jekyll/_cci2/overview.adoc[]` 

== Some notes about formatting

=== Using code blocks in numbered steps
In order to keep numbered steps flowing correctly when code blocks are used inside steps, use the `+` on the line before the block starts to indicate the block is part of the step above.
1. Step one
2. Step two involves some code
+
[source, shell]
----
some code
----
3. Step three is still in number order

=== Style tables correctly for the Jekyll site
In order to make tables display correctly in the web version of Server docs, assign them with the `.table` and `.table-striped` classes:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|column 1
|column 2
|comuln 3

|column 1 row 1
|column 2 row 1
|column 3 row 1

|column 1 row 2
|column 2 row 2
|column 3 row 2
|===
