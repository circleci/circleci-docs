# Contributing to CircleCI Docs

Thank you for your interest in contributing. Getting started is fairly simple.

## Add or fix a doc
[Fork this repository](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs#fork-destination-box), clone your fork to your local machine, work on your contribution in a branch, 
and when ready, [open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
with us.

## Can't fix a doc yourself or have a request?
You can always [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/issues) 
on this repository. There you can let us know what needs a fix, a doc we don't 
have that you would like to see, or leave feedback.

The bottom of every doc at https://circleci.com/docs/ also have convenient 
links to get you started in editing a doc or adding an issue.
