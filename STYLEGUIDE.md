As with code, technical writing benefits from consistent rules. Please follow this guide when adding or editing CircleCI documentation.

# Structure

- Don't use h1 headers. The title you choose in a doc's frontmatter will automatically be converted into an h1.
- Add a table of contents to articles with more than 10 h2s.

# Formatting

- Single-spaced, never double-spaced.

# Lists

- Capitalize each list item.
- Place periods at the end of each list item.

# Bold

- Use for terms that are defined.
- Use for interactive elements, like buttons or links.

# Italics

- Use for emphasis.

# Quotes

- Use for non-interactive elements, like section names.
