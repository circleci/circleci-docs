:page-description: How to configure Nomad clients to run with CircleCI server v4.1 in an air-gapped environment.
:icons: font
:experimental:

CircleCI server uses Nomad clients to perform container-based build actions. These machines will need to exist within the air-gapped environment to communicate with the CircleCI server Helm deployment.

NOTE: In the following sections, replace any sections indicated by `< >` with your details.

[#install-docker-and-nomad]
== 1. Install Docker and Nomad
Install the following two prerequisites on each instance designated as a Nomad client:

- link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[An installation of Docker]
- link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/install[An installation of Nomad]


[#create-nomad-directories]
== 2. Create Nomad directories
On each machine, create a config directory. If your installation uses mTLS, also create a nested SSL directory:

[source, bash]
----
sudo mkdir /etc/nomad/
sudo mkdir /etc/nomad/ssl/
----

[#create-ci-docker-network]
== 3. Create the Docker ci-privileged network
Create a Docker network named `ci-privileged` with the following command. Once complete, restart the Nomad service.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker network create --label keep --driver=bridge --opt com.docker.network.bridge.name=ci-privileged ci-privileged

sudo service nomad restart
----

[#retrieve-mtls-certificates]
== 4. (Optional) Retrieve mTLS certificates

If Nomad mTLS is configured on your installation, you will need to provide three files to each Nomad client. If mTLS is not configured, you can skip this step.

- `ca.pem`
- `key.pem`
- `cert.pem`

These files can be retrieved from a secret in the namespace of the CircleCI server Helm installation (`nomad-rpc-mtls`) using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get secret -n <namespace> nomad-rpc-mtls -o yaml > secret.yaml
----

This command will output the `secret.yaml` file to stdout. Each required file (`ca.pem`, `key.pem`, `cert.pem`) is stored as a base64 encoded string within the secret. Each string must be copied, decoded, and placed in a file in each of your Nomad clients.

[source, bash]
----
# For each of ca.pem, key.pem, cert.pem in the secret output
echo -n "ca.pem-base64-encoded-string" | base64 --decode > ca.pem
echo -n "cert.pem-base64-encoded-string" | base64 --decode > cert.pem
echo -n "key.pem-base64-encoded-string" | base64 --decode > key.pem
----

== 5. (Optional) Copy mTLS keys to each Nomad client
If using mTLS, the `ca.pem`, `key.pem`, and `cert.pem` keys must be copied to each client and placed in the locations listed below. If mTLS is not configured, you can skip this step.

[source, text]
----
/etc/nomad/ssl/ca.pem
/etc/nomad/ssl/cert.pem
/etc/nomad/ssl/key.pem
----

== 6. Configure the Nomad conf.hcl file on each machine
For each Nomad client, configure the following `conf.hcl` file at `/etc/nomad/conf.hcl`. Remember to replace all items displayed between `< >`.

[source, hcl]
----
log_level = "DEBUG"
name = "<instance-hostname>"
data_dir = "/opt/nomad"
datacenter = "default"
advertise {
  http = "<instance-internal-ip>"
  rpc = "<instance-internal-ip>"
  serf = "<instance-internal-ip>"
}

client {
  enabled = true
  server_join = {
    retry_join = ["<kubernetes-cluster-internal-ip>:4647"]
  }
  node_class = "linux-64bit"
  options = {"driver.raw_exec.enable" = "1"}
}

telemetry {
  collection_interval = "1s"
  disable_hostname = true
  prometheus_metrics = true
  publish_allocation_metrics = true
  publish_node_metrics = true
}

----

If mTLS is configured, the following block must also be added at the end of the `conf.hcl` file:

[source, hcl]
----
tls {
  http = false
  rpc  = true
  verify_server_hostname = true
  ca_file       = "/etc/nomad/ssl/ca.pem"
  cert_file = "/etc/nomad/ssl/cert.pem"
  key_file      = "/etc/nomad/ssl/key.pem"
}
----

== 7. Test connectivity
Test connectivity between your clients and cluster by starting the Nomad agent and observing logs.

[source, bash]
----
sudo nomad agent -config /etc/nomad/conf.hcl
----
