This folder contains the build tooling we use for automatically generating
documentation for the CircleCI API v1 and v2. Both currently use
[Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate) and the latter uses
[Widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins) to create documentation
with a spec (that follows the Open API Spec) generated from the CircleCI code
base.

## Contributing

### I want to change something in API v1.

Go to source/includes/* and select the file you want to change. Push your
changes, and then the CI build will generate the new documentation.

### I want to change something in API v2?

You cannot make direct changes to the API v2 from within this repo because it is
built from a **spec** (Using Open API). The specification is generated from a backend
service, from within the code; you will need to speak with a team member who
manages/works on our APIs and ask them to make a change.

### I want to see V1 changes locally.

You will need to follow Slate's local development process. Most of the following content
is parroted from their docs. You will need:

 - **Linux or macOS**
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command does not
   work, run `gem install bundler` in a terminal window.

**NOTE:** The original Slate repository requires that you _fork_ the repo to
build your docs. Instead, we have vendored the repo into _our_ docs. To develop
_our_ API locally, execute the following command:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.

### Updating Slate

Slate is not exactly a library where you can run the `npm install` or `npm update` commands. If
Slate releases an update that we need, currently, it will require us to download
their repo again, and replace the `src` files (but don't delete our
index.html.md!)
